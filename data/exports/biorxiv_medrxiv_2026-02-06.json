The impact of heat stress on this mRNA turnover remains unclear. In heat-shocked yeast cells, the proportion of monosomes within the ribosomal assemblies rises without a corresponding increase in the number of mRNAs associated with them. As a result, most monosomes are devoid of mRNAs and silent, lacking translational initiation facto",

The governments, hospitals, schools, industries, and humans, in general, are looking for a potential solution in the vaccine which will eventually be available but its timeline for eradicating the virus is yet unknown. Several researchers have encouraged and recommended the use of good practices such as physical healthcare monitoring, immunity-boosting, personal h",

Existing contact tracing methodologies produce contact maps of individuals based on a binary definition of contact which can be hampered by missing data and indirect contacts. Here, we present a Spatial-temporal Epidemiological Proximity (StEP) model to recover contact maps in disease outbreaks based on movement data. The StEP model accounts for imperfect data by considering ",

In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on nationa",

N-protein condenses with specific RNA sequences in the first 1000 nts (5’-End) under physiological conditions and is enhanced at human upper airway tempe",
