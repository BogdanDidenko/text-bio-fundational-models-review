Moreover, the hereditary aspect of SZ is supported by the significant involve",

However, the typical tokenization methods employ a basic sliding window of tokens, such as k-mers, that fail to utilize gene-centric semantics. This could result in the (trivial) masking of easily predictable sequences, leading to inefficient MLM training. Time-",

      "abstract": "Codon language modeling is an emerging area of research interest. Prior efforts in codon optimization have mostly focused on the effect codon preferences have on protein translation speed either at single codons (e.g., selection preference measures) or entire gene sequences (e.g., Codon Adaptation Index and related estimates of gene expression). Model parameters are almost always trained based on a specific organism/task. Here we explore a first ever look at the impact of multi-task model pre-tr",

In order to explore the prognostic power of computational histopathology and genomics, this paper constructs a multi-modality prognostic model for survival prediction.

      "abstract": "Identifying pathogenic RNA methylation sites with a reasonable biological explanation has important implications for the treatment of diseases. Due to the limitations of in vitro experiments in identifying pathogenic RNA methylation sites, there is a growing need for computational workflows to enable accurate inference. Here, motivated by this profound meaning, we developed PathoRM, a biologically informed deep learning model, to infer associations between RNA methylation sites and diseases. Pat",
