      "abstract": "Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients. Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis, epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing state-of-the-art  results. Codes will be released ( https://github.com/haipengzhou856/CoC ).",

      "abstract": "Gene expression profiling provides critical insights into cellular heterogeneity, biological processes, and disease mechanisms. There has been an increasing interest in computational approaches that can predict gene expression directly from digitalized histopathology images. While image foundation models have shown promise in a variety of pathology downstream analysis, their performances on gene expression prediction are still limited. Explicitly incorporating information from the transcriptomic models can help image models address domain shift, yet the fine-tuning and alignment of foundation models can be expensive. In this work, we propose Parameter Efficient Knowledge trAnsfer (PEKA), a novel framework that leverages Block-Affine Adaptation and integrates knowledge distillation and structure alignment losses for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We evaluated PEKA for gene expression prediction using multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets (comprising 206,123 image tiles with matched gene expression profiles) that included various types of tissue. PEKA achieved at least 5% performance improvement over baseline foundation models while also outperforming alternative parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. We have released the code, datasets and aligned models at Github to facilitate broader adoption and further development for parameter efficient model alignment.",

      "abstract": "Spatial omics face challenges in achieving high-parameter, multi-omics coprofiling. Serial-section profiling of complementary panels mitigates technical trade-offs but introduces the spatial diagonal integration problem. To address this, here we present SpatialEx and its extension SpatialEx+, computational frameworks leveraging histology as a universal anchor to integrate spatial molecular data across tissue sections. SpatialEx combines a pretrained hematoxylin and eosin foundation model with hypergraph and contrastive learning to predict single-cell omics from histology, encoding multi-neighborhood spatial dependencies and global tissue context. SpatialEx+ further introduces an omics cycle module that encourages cross-omics consistency via slice-invariant mappings, enabling seamless integration without comeasured training data. Extensive validations show superior hematoxylin and eosin-to-omics prediction, panel diagonal integration and omics diagonal integration across various biological scenarios. The frameworks scale to datasets exceeding 1 million cells, maintain robustness with nonoverlapping or heterogeneous sections and support unlimited omics layers in principle. Our work makes multimodal spatial profiling broadly accessible. The SpatialEx(+) framework uses histology to generate and integrate complementary spatial multi-omics data across samples.",

      "abstract": "Predicting protein-DNA binding sites is a challenging computational problem in the field of bioinformatics. Identifying the specific residues where proteins bind to DNA is of paramount importance, as it enables the modeling of their interactions and facilitates downstream studies. Nevertheless, the development of accurate and efficient computational methods for this task remains a persistent challenge. Accurate prediction of protein-DNA binding sites has far-reaching implications for understanding molecular mechanisms, disease processes, drug discovery, and synthetic biology applications. It helps bridge the gap between genomics and functional biology, enabling researchers to uncover the intricacies of cellular processes and advance our knowledge of the biological world. The method used to predict DNA binding residues in this study is a potent combination of conventional bioinformatics tools, protein language models, and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning classifiers. On a dataset of protein-DNA binding sites, our model is meticulously trained, and it is then rigorously examined using several experiments. As indicated by higher predictive behavior with AUC values on two benchmark datasets, the results show superior performance when compared to existing models. The suggested model has a strong capacity for generalization and shows specificity for DNA-binding sites. We further demonstrated the adaptability of our model as a universal framework for binding site prediction by training it on a variety of protein-ligand binding site datasets. In conclusion, our innovative approach for predicting protein-DNA binding residues holds great promise in advancing our understanding of molecular interactions, thus paving the way for several groundbreaking applications in the field of molecular biology and genetics. Our approach demonstrated efficacy and versatility underscore its potential for driving transformative discoveries in biomolecular research.",

However, MTI platforms face challenges such as high costs, tissue loss, lengthy acquisition times, and complex analysis of large, multichannel images with batch effects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel computational method to model the interactions between dozens of panel markers and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining, enabling in-silico generation of marker stains. This approach reduces the reliance on experimentally measured markers, bridging low-cost H&E data with MTI’s high-content information. Our approach uses a two-stage framework for channel-wise bioimage synthesis: first, vector quantization learns a visual token vocabulary, then a bidirectional transformer infers missing markers through masked language modeling. Comprehensive benchmarking across different MTI platforms and tissue types demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in improving marker prediction while maintaining biological relevance. This advance makes high-dimensional multiplex tissue imaging more accessible and scalable, supporting deeper insights and potential clinical applications in cancer research.",

E-mail: glasgows@wustl.edu Derived from an early German proverb (“Der liebe Gott steckt im detail”), the English saying “the devil is in the details” reflects the view that something may seem simple at first look, but in fact will take more time and effort to complete than expected. The corollary is that the details, although seemingly insignificant, may contain unfor",

The impact of heat stress on this mRNA turnover remains unclear. In heat-shocked yeast cells, the proportion of monosomes within the ribosomal assemblies rises without a corresponding increase in the number of mRNAs associated with them. As a result, most monosomes are devoid of mRNAs and silent, lacking translational initiation facto",

However, the rapid and complex evolution of SARS-CoV-2 challenges conventional sequence analysis methods like phylogenetic analysis. The virus picks up and loses mutations independently in multiple",

      "abstract": "Purpose Accurate quantitative survival prediction in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an unmet clinical need. While liquid biopsy is widely used, single circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shows limited predictive power. We developed an interpretable deep-learning model to quantitatively predict outcomes. Methods/patients We integrated data from 1373 advanced NSCLC patients profiled by two ultra-deep ctDNA sequencing assays (MSK-ACCESS and ctDx Lung). Features associated with overall survival (OS) were incorporated into a deep-learning network (DeepSurv), which estimates time-to-event survival probabilities. Model performance was evaluated by time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to interpret model output. Results A total of 1373 patients were analyzed, with 1012 using MSK-ACCESS (discovery) and 361 using ctDx Lung (validation). Among over 40 clinicopathological features, ctDNA status, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentration, age, blood-based TP53 , EGFR , PIK3CA , ARID1A , STK11 and MET mutations significantly predicted OS. In ctDNA-positive patients, TP53/PIK3CA/ARID1A/STK11/MET -mutated patients had significantly inferior OS compared with wildtype patients ( P  < 0.001). Using above variables, DeepSurv was trained and tested in the MSK-ACCESS cohort (12-month AUC = 0.75), outperforming single cfDNA (AUC = 0.66) or ctDNA (AUC = 0.59), and externally validated in the ctDx Lung cohort. Compared with high-risk patients, DeepSurv-identified low-risk patients had significantly longer OS in both discovery (12-month OS 87.8% vs 53.8%, HR 0.32, P  < 0.001) and validation cohorts (73.2% vs 48.4%, HR 0.42, P  < 0.001). SHAP revealed TP53 and cfDNA concentration > 4.8 ng/mL had the most important contributions. Conclusions The interpretable DeepSurv model, integrating multimodal features, enables quantitative survival prediction and risk stratification in advanced NSCLC, facilitating personalized decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Spatial multi-modal data analysis using embeddings from diverse foundation models (spEMO) represents a transformative approach that unifies embeddings from pathology foundation models with those from large language models to advance spatial multi-omics research. Recent advances in pathology foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale histopathology images, have greatly advanced disease-focused applications. At the same time, spatial multi-omic technologies now measure gene and protein expression with high spatial resolution, offering valuable insights into tissue context. Yet, existing models struggle to integrate these complementary data types. Here, to address this challenge, we present spEMO, a computational framework that unifies embeddings from pathology foundation models and large language models for spatial multi-omic analysis. By leveraging multi-modal representations, spEMO surpasses single-modality models across diverse downstream tasks, including spatial domain identification, spot-type classification, whole-slide disease prediction and interpretation, multicellular interaction inference and automated medical reporting. These results highlight spEMO’s strength in both biological discovery and clinical applications. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark task—multi-modal alignment—to evaluate how effectively pathology foundation models retrieve complementary information. Together, spEMO establishes a powerful step towards holistic, interpretable and generalizable AI for spatial biology and pathology.",

      "abstract": "The integration of deep learning with prior knowledge and multi-omics data enables precise synergy prediction of anticancer drug combinations. However, substantial computational and storage requirements challenge deep learning in managing extensive datasets and multi-scenarios. This study proposes a generalized two-stage framework to address this issue. It decomposes the drug synergy prediction into two key modules: offline feature extraction and multi-scenario adaptive prediction. By integrating drug-cell-associated protein-protein interaction networks with pharmacogenomics data, we first employ an edge-augmented GAT to construct powerful offline feature extractors for drugs and cell lines concurrently, which identify their shared patterns. Next, Transformer-based re-embedding is designed to fine-tune offline features online, which captures cross-modal interactions between specific drugs and cell lines. It can serve as a portable module to seamlessly integrate into various predictive modules. Under this framework, we develop GATRSyn, a dedicated two-stage model for multi-scenario drug synergy prediction. Compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models across multiple high-throughput screening datasets, GATRSyn achieves optimal or near-optimal results across eight distinct prediction scenarios. GATRSyn also effectively screens clinically validated or literature-reported synergistic drug combinations lacking measured scores. Moreover, synergy analysis of eight representative samples and enrichment analysis of pivotal proteins of cell lines and drugs highlights GATRSyn’s ability to model and elucidate targeted therapeutic efficacy of drug combinations against intracellular signaling nodes. Our framework enhances large-scale, multi-scenario drug synergy prediction and provides a comprehensive reference for individualized anticancer treatment. Graphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "Early and accurate diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is critical for timely intervention and management. Nevertheless, effectively integrating heterogeneous multi-modal data for AD diagnosis remains worthy of further investigation. Therefore, we propose a supervised contrastive learning framework that integrates single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), plasma proteomics, and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) from a biologically informed perspective, with SNPs influencing protein structure or gene expression levels, ultimately altering brain structure. Through a supervised contrastive learning mechanism, we construct a cross-modal feature space and introduce a similarity-based symmetrical attention mechanism to capture intermodal interactions and mitigate modality heterogeneity. We validate the proposed method on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, and experimental results demonstrate accuracy of 96.1%, 86.2%, and 86.1% for the AD-NC task, MCI-NC task, and AD-MCI task. In addition, the application of explainable methods to our model identified multi-modal biomarkers related to AD diagnosis. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our model in the diagnosis of AD and MCI. Graphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "Background In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a new tool in oncology that can support in the detection of (pre)neoplastic lesions and deciphering carcinogenesis. In particular, modern AI models open up new perspectives for the identification and characterization of early cancer, for molecular subtyping, and for automated hypothesis generation from large multimodal datasets. Materials and methods This narrative review is based on a selective literature search in PubMed on current developments in the use of AI for early cancer detection, carcinogenesis, and research. For this purpose, the terms “AI early cancer detection/screening,” “AI tumor biomarker,” “AI carcinogenesis,” and “AI hypothesis generation oncology” were used, with a particular focus on recent studies published between 2022 and 2025. Results The scoping assessment reveals a wide range of current and emerging AI approaches, for example for use in early cancer detection. In parallel, multimodal AI methods, serum marker-based tumor screening, and foundation models for histopathology and multi-omics datasets are being intensively studied. Advances in AI agents and hypothesis-generating AI are also being addressed. Conclusion Artificial intelligence is already improving routine cancer diagnostics and can broaden the range of methods available for prevention and early detection. AI systems can furthermore drive precision medicine when combined with clinical, pathological, and molecular genetic data. At the same time, limitations such as model generalizability and safety must be continuously addressed before widespread clinical implementation can be achieved. Hintergrund In den letzten Jahren hat sich künstliche Intelligenz (KI) als neues Instrument in der Onkologie etabliert, welches die Erkennung (prä)neoplastischer Läsionen und die Erforschung der Tumorentstehung unterstützen kann. Gerade im Bereich der Identifikation und Charakterisierung früher Krebsformen, der molekularen Subtypisierung und einer automatisierten Hypothesengenerierung aus großen, multimodalen Datensätzen eröffnen moderne KI-Verfahren neue Perspektiven. Material und Methoden Die vorliegende orientierende Übersichtsarbeit basiert auf einer selektiven Literaturrecherche in PubMed zu aktuellen Entwicklungen im Einsatz von KI für die Krebsfrüherkennung, Karzinogenese und Forschung. Dazu wurden die Begriffe „AI early cancer detection/screening“, „AI tumor biomarker“, „AI carcinogenesis“ und „AI hypothesis generation oncology“ verwendet und insbesondere aktuelle Studien aus den Jahren 2022–2025 betrachtet. Ergebnisse Die repräsentative Sichtung zeigt eine Vielzahl von aktuellen und zukünftigen KI-Ansätzen auf, z. B. zum Einsatz in der Krebsfrüherkennung. Parallel werden multimodale KI-Ansätze, serummarkerbasiertes Tumorscreening sowie Foundation-Modelle für Histopathologie und Multi-Omics-Datenbestände intensiv erforscht. Fortschritte bei KI-Agenten und hypothesengenerierender KI werden ebenfalls adressiert. Schlussfolgerung KI verbessert bereits heute die onkologische Routinediagnostik und kann die Methodenvielfalt der Prävention und Früherkennung erweitern. KI-Systeme können darüber hinaus in Verbindung mit klinischen, histopathologischen und molekularen Daten die Präzisionsmedizin vorantreiben. Gleichzeitig müssen Limitationen wie die Generalisierbarkeit und Sicherheit der Modelle fortlaufend adressiert werden, bevor eine breite klinische Anwendung erfolgen kann.",

      "abstract": "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has rapidly gained popularity in the treatment of oncology, bringing about a significant shift in approaches to initial screening, cancer detection, therapy, and control. This study aims to discuss basic developments in AI and ML, specifically Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing, Radiomics, and multi-omics analysis in Oncology. The use of DL in the diagnosis of various medical images and genomic data has greatly improved diagnostic results and treatment planning. Radiomics contains detailed features of the tumor and its response to the treatment. Multi-omics analysis, which encompasses genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, provides a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology and facilitates the development of personalized medicine therapies. However, the use of AI in oncology also presents some ethical and societal concerns, including patients’ privacy, biased algorithms, and the implementation of technology. Addressing these problems is imperative to help in better implementation of the use of AI in Healthcare. The current review also foregrounds the ethical, clinical, and societal implications of AI adoption, emphasizing the need for robust governance, representative datasets, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The future research can be addressed towards the explainability of developed AI models and improvement in the quality of data. Overcoming the mentioned challenges, the efficient use of AIML can offer various benefits such as enhanced accuracy, better treatment and timely intervention for the patients worldwide.

      "abstract": "Ovarian cancer remains a highly lethal malignancy, with advanced-stage diagnosis, recurrence, and chemoresistance, thus limiting clinical outcomes. Traditional biomarkers such as CA-125, BRCA1/2 status, and histopathology offer only a partial view of disease biology, often leading to suboptimal and empiric treatment choices. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) provide new opportunities to improve diagnosis, risk stratification, therapeutic selection, and prevention. By integrating multimodal data, including imaging, clinical records, and multi-omics profiles, AI/ML models can uncover complex patterns that enhance the prediction of treatment response, toxicity, recurrence, and survival. Radiomics and radiomics-based prognostic value (RPV/eRPV) models add further precision by extracting informative imaging phenotypes. Emerging architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based models extend these capabilities by modeling interactions among genetic alterations, pathways, and drug responses. Beyond disease management, AI-driven risk prediction and screening tools are gaining exciting relevance in preventive oncology. This review summarizes current and developing AI/ML applications across ovarian cancer care and highlights the translational challenges and opportunities for integrating explainable AI into the clinical workflows. Collectively, these recent innovations support a more personalized, data-integrated approach to reducing morbidity and improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Background Recent studies have revealed valuable prognostic insights in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histological sections and transcriptomic profiles, suggesting potential applications in machine learning. However, existing methods lack sufficient intra- and inter-modal interactions, and face challenges in clinical validation due to incomplete multimodal data. Methods We proposed PathoGems (PathoGenomics-based integrative survival prediction), a weakly-supervised, interpretable multimodal learning framework that integrates histology and genomic profiles for precise cancer prognosis prediction. To evaluate the robustness of PathoGems, we initially curated a dataset of 1965 cases across four cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including breast, colorectal, glioblastoma, and esophageal cancers. For external validation, PathoGems was further evaluated on four independent cohorts, consisting of 76 breast cancer and 41 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, as well as 102 colorectal cancer and 58 glioblastoma cases from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Results PathoGems effectively stratified patients into favorable and unfavorable risk groups, revealing significant differences in histological patterns, genomic features, and overall survival (log-rank test, p  < 0.05). Moreover, the model’s predictions are further supported by visualization and transcriptomic analysis, enhancing interpretability and reliability. Conclusions By fusing histological and clinicogenomic multimodal models, PathoGems will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool that aids clinicians in making informed decisions and selection personalized treatment strategies for cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide lung cancer is a significant reason for death resulting from cancer with early diagnosis crucial for enhancing patient results. This comprehensive survey looks at the most recent developments in methods for detecting lung cancer by using chest CT scan images. The study describes a broad variety of approaches includes methods for machine learning such random forests support vector machines logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors in addition to deep learning frameworks such as variational autoencoders recurrent neural networks convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Additionally the survey explores hybrid models that combine deep learning and machine learning with nature-inspired optimization techniques to enhance performance. All the techniques discussed in this paper mainly focus on the diagnosis of NSCLC i.e. non-small cell lung cancer as it is more prevalent. The paper also reviews multiple advanced techniques used in diagnosis of lung cancer, including 3D-CNN i.e. Convolutional Neural Networks, multimodal logistic regression models and Cyclic Variational Autoencoders. It highlights key publicly available datasets frequently used in this research area such as LIDC-IDRI (Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative), LUNA16 (Lung Nodule Analysis 2016), the Kaggle lung cancer dataset, NSCLC Radiogenomics and the NIH (National Institutes of Health) chest X-ray database. This survey provides a detailed comparison of each technique, describing their advantages, limitations, and reported performance metrics, especially in terms of classification accuracy. Transfer learning with Vision Transformer achieves the highest accuracy of 94.6%, while 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D -CNN) achieves an accuracy of 93.7%, both of which are showcasing highest performance on applicable datasets. Furthermore, the research demonstrates the potential of emerging techniques like federated learning and explainable AI in addressing challenges pertaining to data privacy and model interpretability. This survey paper reviews several techniques and finds that deep learning is the most extensively researched area in lung cancer diagnosis. This approach is not only widely used but also exhibits notable success in identifying and categorizing lung cancer with a high degree of accuracy.",

This comprehensive survey presents the first systematic analysis of deep learning architectures across four major cancer types (lung, breast, skin, and brain) through three critical data modalities: medical imaging, histopathology, and genomics. Our unique contribution lies in providing a structured taxonomy of multimodal fusion strategies and identifying critical architectural innovations that have emerged in the 2021–2025 period. We systematically analyze 60+ recent studies, revealing that attention-based mechanisms and Transformer architectures demonstrate superior performance in handling heterogeneous cancer data compared to traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis uncovers three key research gaps: (1) limited interpretability frameworks for clinical deployment, (2) insufficient standardization across institutions, and (3) scalability challenges for real-world implementation. This survey uniquely bridges the gap between theoretical deep learning advances and practical oncological applications by proposing a unified framework for multimodal cancer analysis. We provide actionable insights for researchers and clinicians, establishing clear directions for future development in AI-driven cancer care that addresses both technical innovation and clinical translation requirements.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer ranks among the leading dangerous conditions that affect millions of women throughout the world. The three key elements necessary to enhance breast cancer survival rates include early detection followed by accurate diagnosis, and prompt treatment. Modern healthcare developments through Artificial Intelligence (AI) have introduced substantial benefits for breast cancer therapy during the last several years. The analysis evaluates the role of AI technology for breast cancer diagnosis, as well as treatment strategy planning and patient surveillance tasks. The analysis of images using machine learning and deep learning AI methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forest (RF) applications, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) produces high analysis accuracy for mammography and ultrasound tests and histopathology examinations. AI uses large amounts of data in order to forecast and individualize treatment. It enhances accuracy in surgical, immunotherapy, radiation and chemotherapy and limits the side effects. Other innovations used in advancing personalized medicine include the idea of nanoradiogenomics. But there are still hurdles, such as validation in clinical settings and data security, and explainable AI. AI processes big data to make predictions, but its effective utilization and performance should be guided by ethical principles and incorporated in clinical workflows to ensure responsible use in healthcare. The chapter also demonstrates how AI works as a supportive tool for healthcare providers instead of replacing their medical skills by enhancing clinical workflow performance, along with diagnostic precision and healthcare quality in breast cancer care.",

      "abstract": "Current approaches to multimodal survival analysis based on pathology and genomics often apply attention mechanisms at a single stage, thereby missing fine-grained intra-modal details and cross-modal synergies. We propose a novel framework— M ultimodal F usion F ramework with F ull-stage A ttention (MFF-FA)—which integrates attention across three stages: feature extraction, modality alignment, and modality fusion. Specifically, we introduce En-UNI for pathology image sampling and representation, and employ attention modules to enhance latent genomic feature interactions. A convolution-based cross-attention module is further developed to model inter-modal correlations between pathology and genomics. Finally, a gating-attention fusion strategy is applied to retain modality-specific characteristics while enhancing their integration. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that MFF-FA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy for cancer survival analysis.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy affecting women globally that poses a significant health burden, contributing to cancer-related mortality. Even though early detection and treatment strategies have improved over the years, Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) still remains one of the difficult cancers to treat. This is primarily due to the complexity of prediction and understanding its progression. Traditional prognostic models often depend on single-modal data, such as clinical features, and imaging scans. However, these approaches often fail to capture the complex biological and clinical landscape of the disease. Recent technological advancements have enabled the collection of diverse multi-modal data that can provide a comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of breast tumors. This study leverages the power of deep learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network combined with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Transfer Learning, applied to multi-modal data from The Cancer Genome Atlas BRCA (TCGA-BRCA) multi-omics dataset to enhance metastatic breast cancer prediction. Our model achieved an accuracy of 97.4%, demonstrating its potential for improved prognostication. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art approaches from the past decade (2013–2024) was conducted to contextualize our findings and highlight the advancements offered by our multimodal deep learning approach.",

      "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies offer valuable insights into tissue organisation by capturing gene expression within its spatial context. Among these, 10x Visium stands out for its capacity to integrate gene expression profiles with histological images, facilitating multi-modal tissue analysis. However, comprehensive analysis requires manual pathologist’s annotations at the capture spot level, a labour-intensive and time-consuming process that demands a significant amount of pathologists’ time. Given the scale of studies involving multiple ST samples, manual annotation becomes impractical, and no automated solutions currently exist. To address this, we introduce ActiveVisium, an active learning framework designed to enhance spot-level annotation in 10x Visium datasets. To the best of our knowledge, ActiveVisium is the first framework to leverage tissue morphology and, optionally, gene expression data to automate large-scale spot annotation while selecting the most informative ones for manual labelling. Furthermore, this approach enables transfer learning across similar samples, thereby reducing annotation time for entire studies. Evaluations across breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and healthy kidney samples demonstrate that ActiveVisium has the potential to significantly improve annotation efficiency and consistency.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have successfully begun to link molecular data with tissue morphology. To date, this work has largely focused on transcriptomics, a limited surrogate for protein expression. The direct prediction of proteins, the functional endpoints of gene expression, remains underexplored, largely due to the difficulty in generating spatially resolved proteomic data. Early efforts to predict proteomic data from tissue morphology were hindered by low specificity and limited multiplexing capacity, constraints inherent to immunohistochemistry and multiplexed immunofluorescence techniques. This proof-of-concept study presents a novel data generation pipeline to address these throughput and specificity challenges and decode the proteome from H&E slides via high-throughput tile-level mass spectrometry profiling. This approach enables a direct one-to-one correspondence between histological features and proteomic measurements, which is an essential prerequisite for training robust foundation models. By applying this pipeline to gastric cancer biopsies, the study demonstrated that morphologically distinct clusters corresponded to distinct proteomic profiles. Notably, tumor regions were enriched for clinically relevant markers such as HMGB1, LGALS3, and ERBB2, all of which are associated with poor prognosis. This work establishes the foundation for a new generation of AI-driven proteomics, demonstrating that routine histological images contain sufficient information to predict thousands of proteins across diverse biological conditions. TileDVP represents a paradigm shift toward accessible, high-throughput spatial proteomics that could transform biomarker discovery and precision medicine applications.",

      "abstract": "The groundbreaking development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables researchers to map gene expression across tissues with spatial precision. However, current next-generation sequencing methods, which theoretically cover the entire transcriptome, face limitations in resolving spatial gene expression at high resolution. The recently introduced Visium HD technology offers a balance between sequencing depth and spatial resolution, but its complex sample preparation and high cost limit its widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we introduce HISTEX, a multimodal fusion approach that leverages a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism and a general-purpose foundation model. HISTEX integrates spot-based ST data with histology images to predict super-resolution (SR) spatial gene expression. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HISTEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately predicting SR gene expression across diverse datasets from multiple platforms. Moreover, experimental validation underscores HISTEX’s potential to generate new biological insights. It enhances spatial patterns, enriches biologically significant pathways, and facilitates the SR annotation of tissue structures. These findings highlight HISTEX as a powerful tool for advancing ST research. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/wenwenmin/HISTEX .",

      "abstract": "Glioma remains one of the most lethal malignancy, making accurate prognosis crucial for personalized treatment and improved patient outcome. Existing models based on non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer convenience, but they suffer from the poor performance and generalizability compared to genomic biomarkers, limiting their clinical adoption. Genomic biomarkers, such as IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion, provide superior prognostic value but are restricted by their reliance on invasive surgical sampling. In this study, we hypothesize that these genomic biomarkers can guide the development of more robust MRI-based prognostic models, and propose a genomics-guided prompt learning framework that leverages both MRI and transcriptomic data to enhance survival prediction. Specifically, we introduce a novel visual modeling strategy for comprehensive glioma MRI representation and a Prompt-bridged Attention mechanism that can fuse multiple modalities during training and enhance visual representations during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves c-indeces of 0.6709 and 0.6904 on UCSF-PDGM and TCGA-GBM datasets, respectively, with highly significant p-values of $$5.27\\times 10^{-14}$$ 5.27 × 10 - 14 and $$6.72\\times 10^{-7}$$ 6.72 × 10 - 7 . These results substantially outperform existing methods, presenting a promising step toward reliable and non-invasive glioma prognosis prediction.",

However, integrating spatial transcriptomics across multiple slices remains challenging for downstream analyses, as ST slices may exhibit significant batch effects. Current methods mostly depend on forced integration via contrastive learning, which may ignore the inherent biological heterogeneity, thus impacting the performance of downstream analyses. To address these challenges, we introduce MoST-IG , a multimodal framework for morphology-guided multi-slice ST integration. MoST-IG comprises two key components: (1) Cross-modal alignment between histology prior and ST. We integrate histological patterns derived from the pathological foundation model with ST using our proposed Visual-Genomic Graph Optimal Transport (VG-GOT) module. This visual-genomic alignment preserves biological heterogeneity through morphology-guided regularization while enriching the spatial context of ST data with morphological features to provide a more discriminative representation and enhance downstream performance. (2) Integration of Multi ST-Slices. A multi ST-slices Contrastive Learning (mST-CL) module is designed via two complementary triplet losses—one for both inter-slice and intra-slice cell type mapping. Experiments show that MoST-IG outperforms leading methods in both cancer grading and detection, as well as tissue structure clustering, while better preserving tissue landmarks in multi-slice ST integration.

Here, we propose a novel contrastive learning-based approach for single-cell multi-omics data clustering, named scCLC. Taking contrastive learning as backbone, scCLC integrates scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data for cell presentation learning with dedicated data augmentation strategy and self-supervised learning model. scCLC leverages the topological structure derived from single-cell multi-omics data to determine positive pairs, which not only increases the training sample size but also provides basic label priors for the model to learn more cluster-friendly cell representations. The experimental results on single-cell multi-omics datasets show the superior clustering performance of scCLC. When applied to visualization, scCLC can effectively separate the cell subtypes.",

Traditional methods for peptide sequence prediction have certain limitations because they often rely on handcrafted feature extraction and statistical models. To enhance prediction accuracy and rationality, a novel de novo peptide prediction model based on Transformer and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is designed. In this model BERT is firstly used to extract peptide embedding features. These extracted features are integrated with physicochemical characteristics such as precursor mass, mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and intensity to improve global feature representation. A model of the graph structural relationships between peptides using GCN can capture complex interactions to further enhance the capability of representation. Finally, the autoregressive decoder of a GPT-2 generation module is used to generate peptide sequences. And some strategies such as Top-k sampling, Top-p sampling, and temperature control are incorporated to ensure the rationality and diversity of the generated sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an average improvement of 5.29% in amino acid recall and 4.18% in accuracy across multiple datasets compared to DeepNovo. The model effectively enhances the accuracy of de novo peptide sequencing.",

To overcome these challenges, we introduce HiMulti, a novel multi-instance model that integrates pathological images and pathway features for improved survival prediction. HiMulti first processes WSIs into patches and creates a multi-level pyramid through downsampling. It then utilizes an improved mamba-inspired linear attention model and a linear attention transformer for intra- and inter-level feature fusion. Simultaneously, pathway features are constructed from RNA-Seq data. A dual-branch attention mechanism selects key image regions by generating multimodal and single-modal attention weights. Finally, patient-level features are aggregated from these key images for cancer survival prediction. Compared with the existing weakly supervised methods, the average C-Index of HiMulti on the TCGA-LUAD, BRCA, and BLCA datasets increases by 1.39% compared with the sub-optimal value, and the visualization results confirm its superior performance.

      "abstract": "Accurate classification of neuronal cell types is essential for understanding brain organization, but multimodal neuron datasets are scarce and strongly imbalanced across subclasses. We present a benchmark of synthetic data augmentation methods for predicting electrophysiology-defined neuronal classes (e-types) in the Allen Cell Types mouse visual cortex dataset. Two supervised tasks were evaluated over the same 17 e-type labels: prediction from electrophysiology features alone (E→e-type) and prediction from combined morphology plus electrophysiology features (M + E→e-type). We established real-data baselines across multiple classifier families under a unified preprocessing pipeline, then augmented only the training sets using matched per-class grids with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and deep generative models: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), masked autoregressive normalizing flows, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Augmentation produced substantial generalization gains when applied in the native high-dimensional feature space, whereas introducing dimensionality reduction largely suppressed these benefits. SMOTE delivered the most robust and consistent improvements across tasks and augmentation levels. To assess biological realism, we introduced a fidelity framework combining feature-wise distribution comparisons, statistical concordance tests, and distance-based measures that compare synthetic-to-real variability against the natural variability between real classes. Most synthetic datasets stayed within biological diversity bounds, with deviations concentrated in the rarest subclasses. These results provide practical guidance on selecting and validating synthetic augmentation for neuronal subtype classification.",

Integrating multi-omics approaches with AI-driven precision nutrition offers novel insights into how diet modulates neuroimmune, neuroendocrine, and metabolic pathways. This article explores recent advances in microbiome research, highlighting the role of microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) as bioactive carriers that facilitate gut-brain communication by transporting neuroactive metabolites and immune modulators. These findings reveal an underexplored mechanism by which dietary interventions can reshape brain function at the molecular level. Additionally, synthetic biology and CRISPR-mediated microbiome engineering are advancing targeted interventions, allowing precise modulation of microbial gene expression to enhance neuroprotective pathways and mitigate neuroinflammation. Emerging strategies such as psychobiotics, paraprobiotics, and postbiotics further expand this therapeutic landscape, offering novel microbiome-based tools to influence neurotransmission, neuroimmune regulation, and cognitive resilience. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven multi-omics integration further enables predictive modeling of microbiome-neurotransmitter interactions, hence refining personalized nutritional strategies for cognitive resilience and neuroprotection. However, challenges such as inter-individual variability, algorithmic biases, and ethical considerations in AI-driven dietary recommendations must be addressed to ensure the suitability of potential therapies. Future research should focus on in vivo validation of AI-guided dietary interventions through multi-modal neuroimaging, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. These advances position precision nutrition as a transformative tool in neuroscience, bridging microbiome science, AI, and personalized medicine to optimize brain health and mitigate neurodegenerative risks.",

      "abstract": "A drift-aware, generative, and intervention-guided paradigm for early risk assessment of childhood type 2 diabetes using longitudinal multi-omics integration is provided in this study. The suggested method simulates developmental methylation patterns using transcriptome and proteome measurements. The hierarchical representation preserves intra-layer structure and inter-layer interactions while combining molecular layers. For temporal drift, adaptive penalties that favor age-aligned biological progression improve coherence across measurements and reduce divergence that commonly arises when multi-omics signals are modeled independently. Developmentally realistic forward trajectories are generated by this architecture. This design finds directionally consistent CpG loci-regulatory driver linkages using causal graph reasoning. Sparse pruning prioritizes metabolic pathway interactions over unlikely edges. To retain biological fidelity and anchor drift magnitude against clinical advancement, diffusion-based denoising refines acquired methylation sequences in the generating stage. Counterfactual simulation layers examine risk trajectories with lifestyle changes including persistent activity and anthropometric improvements. Individualised simulations reveal how preventive strategies improve glycemic outcomes. Cross-modal coherence, temporal consistency, and trajectory stability are better than recent generative benchmarks without drift constraints or intervention-aware simulation using publically accessible pediatric longitudinal datasets. The integrative technique reduces longitudinal projection cross-modal divergence and produces coherent temporal manifolds for early screening and tiered prevention. Privacy-sensitive contexts benefit from downstream augmentation for data-constrained clinical investigations with synthetic, drift-aligned cohorts. Besides risk estimation, the framework may examine molecular reconfiguration during early metabolic dysregulation. Characterizing directional influence shifts over time gives the model mechanistic insights into regulatory perturbations. These computational tools improve early diabetes risk assessment, precision prevention, and translational research in pediatric metabolic health sets by integrating multi-omics, generative modeling, and intervention inference sets.",

      "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, chronological age, the simple number of years one has lived, does not capture individual health differences, prompting the development of methods to accurately estimate biological age instead of relying on chronological age. One of the major molecular approaches exploits DNA methylation (DNAm), which is an essential epigenetic modifier for regulating gene expression, cell differentiation, and aging. DNAm-based aging clocks have been developed to predict biological age, but the prediction is highly dependent on training data, including organs and assay technologies. To address these clocks’ high variance, we present two EnsembleAge clocks, leveraging eight previously developed DNAm clocks, harnessing the strengths of each methylome age clock, smoothing out individual variances, and providing a more robust estimation of biological age. We trained our EnsembleAge clock models using DNA methylation data from nine organs in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset. Our EnsembleNaive clock model achieved the lowest median absolute error (MeAE) of 4.04 years in whole blood. The EnsembleLR model demonstrated the lowest MeAE of 6.35 years across multiple tissues, including breast, lung, muscle, ovary, prostate, testis, and colon. The significant reduction in MeAE underscores its high practical value in clinical and forensic applications, especially in contexts where epigenetic changes are subtle. We further applied our models to four public datasets representing diverse biological applications, including administered short-term medical opioid use (GSE151485) and long-term opioid overdose (GSE164822). Our model reveals over 10 years of age acceleration in opioid-overdosed brains but no significant epigenetic age acceleration when opioid usage was well administered. Our EnsembleAge clock models are also implemented as a web service, allowing users to conveniently upload their DNA methylation data and receive predictions of their biological age. This empowers individuals to track their biological/epigenetic age over time, mitigating the effect of variance and promoting healthy aging and a beneficial lifestyle.

      "abstract": "Purpose Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with limited therapeutic options owing to poor intrinsic regeneration and the formation of glial scars. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-based biomaterials have emerged as promising candidates for neural repair; however, their application in complete SCI models with rigorous multimodal validation has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to extend the current knowledge on SCI-PRP based study, by developing and comprehensively validating a clinically translatable PRP-derived fibrin scaffold for spinal cord regeneration. Methods PRP-fibrin scaffolds were synthesized from donor-derived plasma and extensively characterized in terms of their physicochemical properties, degradation profiles, protein release dynamics, and cellular compatibility. Its regenerative potential was evaluated using an integrative pipeline that included in ovo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays, a complete spinal cord transection rat model, and multimodal outcome measures, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), retrograde neuronal tract tracing, electrophysiological recordings, and gene expression analyses. Results The scaffold exhibited favorable structural and biochemical characteristics, supported angiogenesis in the CAM assay, and promoted tissue integration in vivo . In an SCI model, the scaffold significantly enhanced neovascularization, reduced glial scarring, and facilitated axonal regeneration. Functional improvements were observed 30 days’ post-implantation. In silico docking further demonstrated stable interactions between scaffold proteins and key neuroregenerative signaling molecules. Conclusion This study provides multimodal validation of the derived fibrin scaffold, establishing it as a robust ECM-mimetic platform for spinal cord repair. These findings lay the groundwork for future clinical translation of SCI therapeutics. Graphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "Background Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), considered the prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is a heterogeneous condition characterised by mild but measurable cognitive decline. However, not all individuals with MCI follow the same trajectory—some remain stable, while others progress rapidly to AD. Understanding variation in clinical, molecular, and imaging features is crucial for reducing disease heterogeneity, improving prognosis, and developing targeted interventions. This study aims to increase MCI subtyping resolution by generating enriched individual-level profiles through the integration of imaging and omics data, facilitating precision medicine approaches for AD prevention and treatment. Methods We used data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including structural MRI, CSF peptidomics/proteomics, and clinical indices. Using a multi-modal integration and clustering framework, we identified distinct MCI subgroups, characterised by clinical and neuropsychological scores, AD biomarkers, biological pathway enrichments, and imaging patterns. We further employed supervised multi-modal integration and correlation analyses to explore the links between imaging, peptidomic/proteomic and clinical features within each subgroup. Additionally, we labelled individuals by future conversion to AD and analysed longitudinal cognitive function (CDRSB and MMSE scores). Finally, we performed in silico drug repurposing to identify candidate drugs targeting each subgroup’s molecular profile. Results (1) Multi-modal integration revealed two distinct MCI subgroups. (2) The Resilient Neuronal Hyperplasticity subgroup was characterised by elevated markers of neuronal plasticity, minimal brain atrophy and cortical thinning, better clinical scores, and upregulated peptide/protein markers associated with less severe structural changes. In contrast, the Vulnerable Neurodegenerative subgroup exhibited AD-like disturbances, pronounced atrophy and cortical thinning, primarily affecting executive functions, and downregulation of peptide/protein markers linked to significant structural changes. (3) Future conversion analysis revealed the second subgroup predominantly comprised fast converters, while the first predominantly consisted of stable individuals. (4) Longitudinal cognitive analysis showed a more pronounced decline in the second subgroup compared to the first. (5) Drug repurposing identified both shared and subgroup-specific candidate compounds aligned with the underlying pathologies. Conclusions This study delineates two MCI subgroups, using multi-modal integration, offering insights into disease heterogeneity and laying the foundation for precision medicine and AI-driven strategies in MCI and AD research and clinical care.",

      "abstract": "The authors find that TDP-43 loss of function—the pathology defining the neurodegenerative conditions ALS and FTD—induces novel mRNA polyadenylation events, which have different effects, including an increase in RNA stability, leading to higher protein levels. Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are cellular hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43 nuclear loss causes de-repression of cryptic exons, yet cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events have been largely overlooked. In this study, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline to reliably identify alternative last exons, 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) extensions and intronic polyadenylation APA event types, and we identified cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. TDP-43 binding sites are enriched at sites of these cryptic events, and TDP-43 can both repress and enhance APA. All categories of cryptic APA were also identified in ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) postmortem brain tissue. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) revealed that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript levels and that cryptic 3’UTR extensions can increase RNA stability, leading to increased translation. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces cryptic APA, expanding the palette of known consequences of TDP-43.",

      "abstract": "Survival prediction involves multiple factors, such as histopathological image data and omics data, making it a typical multimodal task. In this work, we introduce semantic annotations for genes in different cell types based on cell biology knowledge, enabling the model to achieve interpretability at the cellular level. Since these cell type annotations are derived from the unique sites of origin for each cancer type, they can be more closely aligned with morphological features in whole slide images (WSIs) and address the issue of genomic annotation ambiguity. We then propose a multimodal fusion model, SurvTransformer, with multi-layer attention to fuse cell type tags (CTTs) and WSIs for survival prediction. Finally, through attention and integrated gradient attribution, the model provides biologically meaningful interpretable analysis at three different levels: cell type, gene, and histopathology image. Comparative experiments show that SurvTransformer achieves the highest consistency index across four cancer datasets. The survival curves generated are also statistically significant. Ablation experiments show that SurvTransformer outperforms models based on different labeling methods and attention representations. In terms of interpretability, case studies validate the effectiveness of SurvTransformer at three levels: cell type, gene, and histopathological image. Graphical Abstract",

Validation across multiple independent datasets and clinical samples confirmed the feasibility and accuracy of FOSB and JUNB as clinical diagnostic biomarkers for AAA. Conclusions Through the analysis of single-cell and bulk data, hallmarks of human AAA cellular landscape and T-cell comprehensive developmental relationships were recapitulated. This study identified important roles of T-cell and the molecular mechanisms for the dynamic T-cell infiltrating process, which could characterize disease status and landscape of human AAA microenvironment. Using the deep learning algorithms, FOSB and JUNB were demonstrated as pivotal biomarkers of AAA, together with screening the potential pharmacologic agents targeting T-cell polarization. Taken together, this expands the current understanding of AAA pathogenesis and may provide a feasible immune-targeted therapeutic strategy.",

      "abstract": "Laryngeal cancer is a malignancy of the vocal cords and surrounding tissues and creates considerable distress because it interferes with vital functions such as breathing, talking, and swallowing. Early detection and diagnosis play an important role in improving patient outcomes. Existing methods of testing, imaging, and histopathological examination of the tissues still face major challenges in early cancer detection and defining intricate tumor characteristics. With the increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in oncology, it holds transformational capabilities that can revolutionize diagnosis and personalized treatment. This research paper presents the latest advances in AI applications in comprehensive data ranges such as videomics, voice analysis, radiomics, genomics, and clinical examination and assesses them against laryngeal cancer management. By application through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, the AI can analyze complex datasets to understand subtle patterns and clinical outcome predictions with unprecedented accuracy. AI-driven methodologies are promising to identify early-stage cases and provide personalized treatment management. Meanwhile, diverse data collection, robust multimodal data integration, and efficient clinical applicability remain challenges. This analysis collates the important results found within the current literature and identifies crucial research gaps and additional aspects for the future development of improved AI-based diagnosis and prognosis. Merging the bifurcation between conventional medical practices and computational advancements, this study highlights AI’s role in optimizing prognosis and survival for patients suffering from laryngeal cancer. The result indicates how promising AI would be in determining oncology’s future and patient care level.",

To address this, we present Thor, a comprehensive platform for cell-level analysis of spatial transcriptomics and histological images. Thor employs an anti-shrinking Markov diffusion method to infer single-cell spatial transcriptome from spot-level data, effectively combining gene expression and cell morphology. The platform includes 10 modular tools for genomic and image-based analysis, and is paired with Mjolnir, a web-based interface for interactive exploration of gigapixel images. Thor is validated on simulated data and multiple spatial platforms (ISH, MERFISH, Xenium, Stereo-seq). Thor characterizes regenerative signatures in heart failure, screens breast cancer hallmarks, resolves fine layers in mouse olfactory bulb, and annotates fibrotic heart tissue. In high-resolution Visium HD data, it enhances spatial gene patterns aligned with histology. By bridging transcriptomic and histological analysis, Thor enables holistic tissue interpretation in spatial biology. Zhang, Chen, and colleagues present Thor, a platform that turns spot-level spatial transcriptomics into single-cell gene maps using the paired histology image, without using single-cell RNA-seq data.

      "abstract": "Purpose Classification of viral DNA sequences poses significant challenges in computational genomics, particularly in multi-class classification across diverse diseases. Existing studies often focus on binary or small-scale classifications, leaving a gap in addressing large-scale problems. Unbalanced datasets, where certain classes dominate due to limited data availability, further hinder model generalizability and accuracy. This article addresses these challenges and gaps in literature. We selected 17 distinct variants across six viruses: SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Delta, Omicron), Influenza subtypes (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma), Hepatitis virus variants (B, C, D, E), Dengue Virus (Type1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4), HIV, and Ebola. This study includes the largest number of distinct variants in a balanced dataset for classification reported in the literature. Methods Using a balanced dataset of 17,000 samples, the study ensures robust model performance while mitigating data imbalance biases. A novel Multi-Modal Dual Pathway Network is proposed, leveraging hierarchical channel-spatial attention and adaptive feature fusion to integrate complementary features. Genomic image processing techniques, including frequency chaos game representation (FCGR), Markov transition fields (MTF), and Gramian angular summation fields (GAF), enhance feature extraction. ResNet-50 pathways with convolutional block attention module (CBAM) refine feature maps for both scratch-trained and pre-trained pathways. Results The proposed model achieves a peak accuracy of 99.17% with MTF Order 2 fused with MTF Order 4. Other combinations, such as FCGR K=2 fused with MTF Order 4, also exceed 99.09% accuracy, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness. Conclusion This work sets a new benchmark for viral DNA classification, addressing data imbalance and advancing computational genomics through innovative methodologies.",

The single-cell generative pretrained transformer protocol provides a structured framework for single-cell analysis using the pretrained foundation model and serves as an alternative to methods such as Seurat, scPred, scArches or Geneformer. Single-cell generative pretrained transformer is a foundation model based on a transformer architecture for cell-type classification. This protocol enables fine-tuning single-cell generative pretrained transformer for efficient handling of single-cell RNA sequencing data and improving annotation accuracy using retinal cells as working example. Single-cell research faces challenges in accurately annotating cell types at high resolution, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets and rare cell populations. To address this, foundation models such as single-cell generative pretrained transformer (scGPT) offer flexible, scalable solutions by leveraging transformer-based architectures. Here we provide a comprehensive guide to fine-tuning scGPT for cell-type classification in single-cell RNA sequencing data. We demonstrate how to fine-tune scGPT on a custom retina dataset, highlighting the model’s efficiency in handling complex data and improving annotation accuracy achieving 99.5% F1-score. This protocol automates key steps, including data preprocessing, model fine-tuning and evaluation. This protocol enables researchers to efficiently deploy scGPT for their own datasets. The provided tools, including a command-line script and Jupyter Notebook, simplify the customization and exploration of the model, proposing an accessible workflow for users with minimal Python and Linux knowledge. The protocol offers an off-the-shell solution of high-precision cell-type annotation using scGPT for researchers with intermediate bioinformatics.

Artificial intelligence has revolutionized computational biology. Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology. However, current computational models focus on either omics or image analysis, lacking their integration. To address this, we developed OmiCLIP, a visual–omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into ‘sentences’ by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train OmiCLIP integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on OmiCLIP, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk RNA sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image–transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness.",

      "abstract": "Phosphorus is essential for life and critically influences marine productivity. Despite geochemical evidence of active phosphorus cycling in deep-sea cold seeps, the microbial processes involved remain poorly understood. Traditional sequence-based searches often fail to detect proteins with remote homology. To address this, we developed a deep learning model, LucaPCycle, integrating raw sequences and contextual embeddings based on the protein language model ESM2-3B. LucaPCycle identified 5241 phosphorus-cycling protein families from global cold seep gene and genome catalogs, substantially enhancing our understanding of their diversity, ecology, and function. Among previously unannotated sequences, we discovered three alkaline phosphatase families that feature unique domain organizations and preserved enzymatic capabilities. These results highlight previously overlooked ecological importance of phosphorus cycling within cold seeps, corroborated by data from porewater geochemistry, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics. We revealed a previously unrecognized diversity of archaea, including Asgardarchaeota, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and Thermoproteota, which contribute to organic phosphorus mineralization and inorganic phosphorus solubilization through various mechanisms. Additionally, auxiliary metabolic genes of cold seep viruses primarily encode the PhoR-PhoB regulatory system and PhnCDE transporter, potentially enhancing their hosts’ phosphorus utilization. Overall, LucaPCycle are capable of accessing previously ‘hidden’ sequence spaces for microbial phosphorus cycling and can be applied to various ecosystems. The microbial processes involved in deep sea phosphorous cycling are unclear. Here, the authors develop a deep learning model, LucaPCycle, identifying alkaline phosphatase families and archaea that contribute to phosphorous cycling in deep sea cold seeps.",

      "abstract": "Background Identifying GPCR-compound interactions (GCI) plays a significant role in drug discovery and chemogenomics. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has become increasingly influential in this domain. Large molecular models, due to their ability to capture detailed structural and functional information, have shown promise in enhancing the predictive accuracy of downstream tasks. Consequently, exploring the performance of these models in GCI prediction, as well as evaluating their effectiveness when integrated with other deep learning models, has emerged as a compelling research area. This paper aims to investigate these challenges. Results This study introduces EnGCI, a novel model comprising two distinct modules. The MSBM integrates a graph isomorphism network (GIN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from GPCRs and compounds, respectively. These features are then processed by a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for decision-making. The LMMBM utilizes two large-scale pre-trained models to extract features from compounds and GPCRs, and subsequently, KAN is again employed for decision-making. Each module leverages different sources of multimodal information, and their fusion enhances the overall accuracy of GPCR-compound interaction (GCI) prediction. Evaluating the EnGCI model on a rigorously curated GCI dataset, we achieved an AUC of approximately 0.89, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art benchmark models. Conclusions The EnGCI model integrates two complementary modules: one that learns molecular features from scratch for the GPCR-compound interaction (GCI) prediction task, and another that extracts molecular features using pre-trained large molecular models. After further processing and integration, these multimodal information sources enable a more profound exploration and understanding of the complex interaction relationships between GPCRs and compounds. The EnGCI model offers a robust and efficient framework that enhances GCI predictive capabilities and has the potential to significantly contribute to GPCR drug discovery.",

We then cover the essential preprocessing step of tokenization, from character-level encoding to padded, one-hot representations. Next, we derive the math and code for RNN forward propagation, detailing single-cell operations, hidden-state updates, and full-sequence passes. We tackle training challenges—vanishing and exploding gradients—and experiment with remedies such as gradient clipping and better weight initialization. Finally, we explore creative text generation with temperature-controlled sampling and walk through an end-to-end case study: training an RNN to invent novel botanical family names.

      "abstract": "Alterations in the KMT2D or KDM6A genes, which play a role in regulating gene expression, lead to Kabuki syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Individuals with Kabuki syndrome often face learning difficulties, ranging from mild to severe intellectual disabilities, as well as developmental delays. The diagnosis can be confirmed through genetic testing. This research operates at the convergence of genomics, rare disease diagnostics, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning, with the goal of enhancing the diagnosis of Kabuki Syndrome (KS). Traditional diagnostic methods, which often depend on expensive genetic testing, can be slow and may produce inconclusive findings. By utilizing generative AI models such as phenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT, this study harnesses advanced NLP to extract and interpret phenotypic data directly from clinical documentation. PhenoBCBERT is specifically designed to identify phenotypic terms related to KS, whereas PhenoGPT synthesizes patient narratives to create potential diagnostic recommendations. This AI-powered strategy aids clinicians by delivering quicker and more precise diagnostic insights, minimizing the dependence on genetic tests, and improving early detection. The study illustrates the capabilities of generative AI in diagnosing rare diseases. Through thorough evaluation on clinical datasets, our method shows significant enhancements in both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, especially in differentiating KS from phenotypically similar disorders. Furthermore, our models offer transparency by emphasizing the specific phenotypic characteristics that contribute to each diagnostic recommendation, which could assist clinicians in their decision-making process. Our results with accuracy of 92.4% suggest that incorporating phenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT into clinical practices has the potential to improve the early detection and diagnosis of KS, potentially speeding up interventions and resulting in better outcomes for patients. This study highlights the promise of generative AI in the realm of rare disease diagnostics and sets the stage for future applications in other intricate genetic disorders.",

      "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as central regulators of gene expression, have been demonstrated to be deeply involved in the pathogenic processes of various diseases. In current clinical practice, modulating microRNA expression through pharmacological intervention has become an important therapeutic approach for various diseases. However, the emergence of miRNA drug resistance during treatment can significantly compromise therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, accurate prediction of miRNA drug resistance not only provides a basis for developing personalized treatment regimens in clinical practice, but also effectively enhances disease treatment outcomes. The inherent complexity of miRNA-target interaction networks and the multifactorial nature of drug resistance mechanisms pose substantial challenges for conventional experimental approaches, which are often limited by high costs and low throughput. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies in recent years has opened new avenues to address these challenges through computational approaches based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a dual-channel model based on feature alignment, DCMFA, for miRNA drug resistance prediction. DCMFA enhances its data comprehension and analytical capabilities by integrating multimodal information to comprehensively capture enriched features between nodes, thereby improving its adaptability and generalization performance. Additionally, DCMFA employs a modular learning framework with two independent modules dedicated to processing distinct node feature groups. This architecture effectively prevents noise interference from irrelevant feature interactions while enabling each module to capture latent patterns within specific feature subsets, thereby facilitating cross-type feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that through five-fold cross-validation, DCMFA achieved impressive performance metrics: AUC (95.40%), ACC (91.32%), F1 (91.29%), Precision (91.57%), and AUPR (94.60%), outperforming state-of-the-art models by 1.19%, 3.51%, 3.48%, 3.20%, and 0.32% respectively.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have enabled the generation of gene expression profiles alongside histopathological images while preserving spatial context. Effectively integrating gene expression data with spatial information is crucial for accurately identifying spatial domains, a task that is essential for downstream analyses. Several methods have been developed to combine histopathological images with spatial transcriptomics data. However, these approaches often either use images solely to infer spatial relationships between spots or learn embeddings for gene expression and images separately, without fully integrating the information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning method, named STCON, for spatial domain identification. Specifically, we use Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNs) to extract embeddings from two patterns of gene expression profiles and histopathological images. We align gene expression and histopathological information in a low-dimensional space through contrastive learning, and then further optimize the alignment of image information with gene expression through cross-modal prediction. We evaluated STCON on four real spatial transcriptomics datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that STCON achieves competitive performance in spatial domain identification compared with four state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, STCON effectively detects spatially variable genes (SVGs) with enriched expression patterns in the identified domains. Overall, STCON represents a powerful and efficient computational framework for spatial domain identification in spatial transcriptomics data.",

      "abstract": "Silencers are key gene regulatory elements that control gene expression and maintain genomic stability. Dysregulation of silencers is linked to diseases like cancer and genetic disorders. Traditional silencer identification relies on manually extracted features, which are time-consuming, costly, and inefficient. Moreover, most studies focus on local DNA sequence features, neglecting contextual relationships that limit model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose DCFICSH, a deep learning framework that employs dual-channel fusion with distinct automated encoding methods for DNA sequences, incorporating omics data as an additional modality. This multi-modal approach enriches the model’s understanding by integrating both DNA sequence and omics data, allowing for a more comprehensive identification of silencers by capturing both local and contextual features. We enhance feature extraction with BiGRU, which captures sequence dependencies, and Transformer, which extracts long-range dependencies via self-attention. DCFICSH improves AUROC and AUPR by 1% to 2% over existing methods for silencer recognition in HepG2 and K562 cell lines. Additionally, we have developed a public web server that offers all relevant resources for this study, enabling researchers to quickly perform silencer predictions.

To address those challenges, we introduce scPER2P, an end-to-end deep learning framework that translates single-cell RNA-seq data into proteome profiles. Our model includes single-cell language models and incorporates parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to facilitate proteome profile inference. Experimental results across multiple datasets reflect that scPER2P not only achieves high correlation coefficients and cosine similarities with true proteomic profiles but also maintains promising performance with significantly fewer parameters than the full fine-tuning methods. Additionally, cell type clustering results underscore the model’s capability to significantly improve the accuracy of cell type annotation tasks. Our approach offers a promising solution to enhance and complement proteome profiling in single-cell studies. Code and data are available at https://github.com/WangyuchenCS/scPER2P .",

This study explores a machine learning (ML) approach leveraging the Bio-Hermes dataset, which integrates blood-derived proteomics, neuropsychological test results, and demographic variables to improve the classification of individuals into cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD categories. We implement four ML models: Elastic Net, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results indicate that XGBoost achieves the highest accuracy (0.81) and a strong area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) (0.94), highlighting the potential of multimodal ML models in dementia classification. Additionally, the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the proteomic marker pTau181 emerged as key predictive variables. This study underscores the feasibility of using blood-based proteomics in conjunction with cognitive assessments for early AD detection and advocates for further validation on larger, diverse cohorts.",

Using advanced models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative AI addresses issues such as data augmentation, synthetic image production, and anomaly detection. These characteristics improve diagnosis accuracy, permit more tailored therapy, and accelerate healthcare processes. In medical education, generative AI offers immersive simulations for realistic surgical training, as well as interactive learning experiences, which aid in the bridge between academic knowledge and practical expertise. New technologies, like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), multimodal data integration, and quantum computing, are broadening the scope of generative AI. These innovations make precision medicine possible by merging imaging and genomics, enhance surgical accuracy with AR/VR applications, and increase computational efficiency when dealing with massive datasets.

However, existing methods may not sufficiently model the shared or complementary information for more effective integration. In this study, we introduce a Unified Modeling Enhanced Multimodal Learning (UMEML) framework that employs a hierarchical attention structure to effectively leverage shared and complementary features of both modalities of histology and genomics. Specifically, to mitigate unimodal bias from modality imbalance, we utilize a query-based cross-attention mechanism for prototype clustering in the pathology encoder. Our prototype assignment and modularity strategy are designed to align shared features and minimizes modality gaps. An additional registration mechanism with learnable tokens is introduced to enhance cross-modal feature integration and robustness in multimodal unified modeling. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in glioma diagnosis and prognosis tasks, underscoring its superiority in precision neuro-Oncology.",

      "abstract": "Cell state dynamics underlying successful tissue regeneration are undercharacterized. In the intestine, damage prompts epithelial reprogramming into revival stem cells (revSCs) that reconstitute Lgr5^+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Here single-nuclear multi-omics of mouse crypts regenerating from irradiation shows revSC chromatin accessibility overlaps with ISCs and differentiated lineages. While revSC genes themselves are accessible throughout homeostatic epithelia, damage-induced remodelling of chromatin in the crypt converges on Hippo and the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signalling pathway, which we show is transiently activated and directly induces functional revSCs. Combinatorial gene expression analysis further suggests multiple sources of revSCs, and we demonstrate TGFβ can reprogramme enterocytes, goblet and paneth cells into revSCs and show individual revSCs form organoids. Despite this, loss of TGFβ signalling yields mild regenerative defects, whereas interference in both Hippo and TGFβ leads to profound defects and death. Intestinal regeneration is thus poised for activation by a compensatory system of crypt-localized, transient morphogen cues that support epithelial reprogramming and robust intestinal repair. Using deep single-nucleus multi-omics profiling, Fink et al. report transition states between crypt epithelial cells and a revival stem cell lineage. They find that the TGFβ and Hippo signalling pathways cooperatively drive intestinal regeneration.",

      "abstract": "Microglia and astrocytes are key players in neuroinflammation and ischemic stroke. A1 astrocytes are a subtype of astrocytes that are extremely neurotoxic and quickly kill neurons. Although the detrimental A1 astrocytes are present in many neurodegenerative diseases and are considered to accelerate neurodegeneration, their role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke is poorly understood. Here, we combined RNA-seq, molecular and immunological techniques, and behavioral tests to investigate the role of A1 astrocytes in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. We found that astrocyte phenotypes change from a beneficial A2 type in the acute phase to a detrimental A1 type in the chronic phase following ischemic stroke. The activated microglial IL1α, TNF, and C1q prompt commitment of A1 astrocytes. Inhibition of A1 astrocytes induction attenuates reactive gliosis and ameliorates morphological and functional defects following ischemic stroke. The crosstalk between astrocytic C3 and microglial C3aR contributes to the formation of A1 astrocytes and morphological and functional defects. In addition, NF-κB is activated following ischemic stroke and governs the formation of A1 astrocytes via direct targeting of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Taken together, we discovered that A2 astrocytes and A1 astrocytes are enriched in the acute and chronic phases of ischemic stroke respectively, and that the C3/C3aR/NF-κB signaling leads to A1 astrocytes induction. Therefore, the C3/C3aR/NF-κB signaling is a novel therapeutic target for ischemic stroke treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cancer is one of the biggest challenges in global health, thus it forms a critical need for early detection technologies that could improve patient prognosis and inform treatment decisions. This development in the form of an early detection mechanism increases the chances of successful treatment and survival, as early diagnosis promptly offers interventions that can dramatically reduce the rate of deaths attributed to this disease. Here, a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed for cervical cancerous cell detection. It includes three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes and max-pooling layers, followed by dropout and dense layers for improved feature extraction and robust learning. By using ResNet models as inspiration, the model further innovates by incorporating skip connections into the CNN design. By enabling direct feature transmission from earlier to later layers, skip links enhance gradient flow and help preserve important spatial information. By boosting feature propagation, this integration increases the model’s ability to recognize minute patterns in cervical cell images, hence increasing classification accuracy. In our methodology, the SIPaKMeD dataset has been employed which contains 4049 cervical cell images that are arranged into five different categories. To address class imbalance, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been applied for data augmentation; that is, synthetic images have been created, that improve the diversity of the dataset and further enhance the robustness of the same. The present model is astonishingly accurate in classifying five cervical cell types: koilocytes, superficial-intermediate, parabasal, dyskeratotic, and metaplastic, thus significantly enhancing early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer. The model gives an excellent performance because it has a validation accuracy of 99.11% and a training accuracy of 99.82%. It is a reliable model in the diagnosis of cervical cancerous cells because it ensures advancement in the computer-assisted cervical cancer detection system.",
