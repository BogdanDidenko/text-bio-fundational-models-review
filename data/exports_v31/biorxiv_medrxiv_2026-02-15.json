      "title": "SCARF: Single Cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq Foundation model",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell multi-omics have provided unprecedented insights into gene regulation by jointly profiling transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) landscapes. However, the inherent heterogeneity and high dimensionality of these multimodal data present significant challenges for effective integration and downstream analysis. Foundation models have demonstrated strong representation learning capabilities for scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq data. So far, however, no model has been specifically developed for the integrative analysis of these two modalities. Here, we introduce SCARF, a s ingle c ell A TAC-seq and R NA-seq f oundation model. SCARF is pre-trained on X-Omics, the largest curated collection of single-cell multi-omics data to date, comprising over 2.7 million cells across multiple tissues and species. The model utilizes a Mamba architecture for efficiently capturing long-context relationships between genes and between accessible regions. Modality-specific and shared features are learned by the model through self-supervised learning and contrastive learning, respectively. SCARF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including cell representation, cell matching, and cross-omics translation. Furthermore, SCARF enables few-shot cell type annotation, demonstrating strong generalizability across previously unseen datasets. These results highlight the power of foundation models for advancing integrative analysis of single cell multi-omics data, with broad applications in important tasks including cellular characterization, gene or genomic perturbation analysis, and regulation network analysis.",

      "title": "Atacformer: A transformer-based foundation model for analysis and interpretation of ATAC-seq data",
      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>  Chromatin accessibility profiling is an important tool for understanding gene regulation and cellular function. While public repositories house nearly 10,000 scATAC-seq experiments, unifying this data for meaningful analysis remains challenging. Existing tools struggle with the scale and complexity of scATAC-seq datasets, limiting tasks like clustering, cell-type annotation, and reference mapping. A promising solution is using foundation models adapted to specific tasks via transfer learning. While transfer learning has been applied to scRNA-seq, its potential for scATAC-seq remains underexplored. <h4>Methods</h4>  We introduce Atacformer, a transformer-based foundation model for scATAC-seq data analysis. Unlike other models that only produce cell-level representations, Atacformer generates embeddings for individual cis-regulatory elements. Pre-trained on a large atlas of scATAC-seq experiments, Atacformer learns robust representations of genomic regulatory regions for downstream use. After pretraining, the model is fine-tuned for cell-type prediction and batch correction. We also integrated Atacformer with RNA-seq data to build a Contrastive RNA-ATAC Fine Tuning (CRAFT) model capable of cross-modal alignment and RNA imputation from ATAC data. <h4>Results</h4>  Atacformer matches or exceeds leading scATAC-seq clustering tools in adjusted rand index and runtime, with fine-tuned models achieving top performance across datasets. It processes raw fragment files end-to-end 80% faster than existing tools while preserving biological structure. Fine-tuned on bulk BED files, it recovers cell type and assay labels with  > 80% accuracy. We show how the Atacformer architecture produces contextualized embeddings of individual genomic regions, which we use to identify unannotated, cell-type-specific promoter elements directly from chromatin accessibility data.",

      "title": "Language may be all omics needs: Harmonizing multimodal data for omics understanding with CellHermes",
      "abstract": "Decoding cellular systems requires integrating diverse omics data, yet most models are trained from scratch on a single modality, restricting generalization. Here we present CellHermes, a biological language model that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to integrate multimodal forms of omics data, such as transcriptomic profile and PPI network, through natural language for better omics understanding. By reformulating these datasets into question-answer pairs, CellHermes emulates multiple self-supervised learning paradigms within a single, universal, language-based framework with LORA fine-tuning on existing natural language-LLM, achieving comparable or even better performance compared to current single-cell foundation models. Within this framework, CellHermes functions as an encoder, a predictor and an explainer for supporting a range of downstream tasks. For encoder, CellHermes encodes biological entities with embeddings that enable accurate network discovery and cross-dataset generalization; For predictor, CellHermes unifies heterogeneous downstream tasks by translating them into natural language question-answers pairs, allowing a single model to perform multi-task prediction by instruction fine-tuning; For explainer, CellHermes explains molecular mechanisms by combining attention analysis with text-based reasoning, leveraging the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We evaluated the ability of CellHermes as an  encoder on representing genes and cells using 5 gene-level downstream tasks and 5 diverse single-cell datasets across different tissues compared with other single cell foundation models. We also evaluated CellHermes as a  predictor on BioUniBench, a new benchmark of 10 tasks across 7 databases for LLMs, including perturbation response, cell fitness estimation, gene-disease association, and cell type identification. All benchmarks suggest CellHermes can unify multiple biological tasks within one model without compromising performance. By applying CellHermes as an  explainer for a melanoma patients dataset, it can uncover potential key genes on tumor-reactive T cells. Together, CellHermes establishes natural language as a unifying medium for omics, offering a foundation that, in the future, potentially enables a more integrated and interpretable research loop of biological representation, prediction, and interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Recent large-scale single-cell foundation models have shown promise for exploring cellular states, yet they often underperform compared to simpler, domain-specific methods, raising concerns about their broader applicability. A key limitation lies in their reliance on masked language modeling, which is well suited for generative language tasks but poorly aligned with learning rich cell-level embeddings required in single-cell biology. Moreover, the proliferation of transcriptomic technologies—from whole transcriptome dissociated assays to image-based targeted profiling—poses a major challenge for cross-platform generalization. Here, we align with recent advances in machine learning to move beyond reconstruction metrics, which often do not capture important sample variation. We present scConcept (“contrastive cell pre-training”), a transformer-based contrastive learning framework that directly optimizes cell embeddings by contrasting multiple views of cells. By replacing gene-level reconstruction with a cell-level identification task, scConcept learns robust representations that are invariant to count distributions and gene panel selection, across diverse assays and technologies. To highlight the capability of the proposed framework, we pretrain scConcept on a similar corpus of over 30 million single-cell RNA-seq profiles as recent foundation models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance not only compared to state-of-the-art pretrained foundation models but also domain-specific methods in various downstream tasks, including cell-type annotation, technology integration, dissociated to spatial cell-type transfer, spatial imputation, gene panel optimization, and mapping new technologies on already existing atlases. Our results highlight contrastive pretraining as a powerful alternative to reconstruction-based strategies for single-cell modeling, providing a path toward general-purpose, technology-agnostic cell representations.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>  Large foundation models have revolutionized single-cell analysis, yet no kidney-specific model currently exists, and it remains unclear whether organ-focused models can outperform generalized models. The kidney’s complex cellular architecture and dynamic microenvironments further complicate integration of large-scale single-cell and spatial omics data, where current frameworks trained on limited datasets struggle to correct batch effects, capture cross-modality variation, and generalize across species. <h4>Methods</h4>  We developed Nephrobase Cell+, the first kidney-focused large foundation model, pretrained on ~100 billion tokens from ~39.5 million single-cell and single-nucleus profiles across 4,319 samples, four mammalian species (human, mouse, rat, pig), and multiple assay modalities (scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics). Nephrobase Cell+ uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with gene-token cross-attention and a mixture-of-experts module for scalable representation learning. <h4>Results</h4>  Nephrobase Cell+ sets a new benchmark for kidney single-cell analysis. It produces tightly clustered, biologically coherent embeddings in human and mouse kidneys, far surpassing previous foundation models such as Geneformer, scGPT, and UCE, as well as traditional methods such as PCA and autoencoders. It achieves the highest cluster concordance and batch-mixing scores, effectively removing donor/assay batch effects while preserving cell-type structure. Cross-species evaluation shows superior alignment of homologous cell types and >90% zero-shot annotation accuracy for major kidney lineages in both human and mouse. Even its 1B-parameter and 500M variants consistently outperform all existing models. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  With organ-scale multimodal pretraining and a specialized transformer architecture, Nephrobase Cell+ delivers a unified, high-fidelity representation of kidney biology that is robust, cross-species transferable, and unmatched by current single-cell foundation models, offering a powerful resource for kidney genomics and disease research.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how regulatory DNA elements shape gene expression across individual cells is a fundamental challenge in genomics. Joint RNA-seq and epigenomic profiling provides opportunities to build unifying models of gene regulation capturing sequence determinants across steps of gene expression. However, current models, developed primarily for bulk omics data, fail to capture the cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes revealed by single-cell multi-modal technologies. Here, we introduce scooby, the first framework to model scRNA-seq coverage and scATAC-seq insertion profiles along the genome from sequence at single-cell resolution. For this, we leverage the pre-trained multi-omics profile predictor Borzoi as a foundation model, equip it with a cell-specific decoder, and fine-tune its sequence embeddings. Specifically, we condition the decoder on the cell position in a precomputed single-cell embedding resulting in strong generalization capability. Applied to a hematopoiesis dataset, scooby recapitulates cell-specific expression levels of held-out genes, and identifies regulators and their putative target genes through in silico motif deletion. Moreover, accurate variant effect prediction with scooby allows for breaking down bulk eQTL effects into single-cell effects and delineating their impact on chromatin accessibility and gene expression. We anticipate scooby to aid unraveling the complexities of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells.",

      "abstract": "Single-cell multi-omics technologies enable the simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, providing complementary insights into cellular identity and gene regulatory mechanisms. However, integrating paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data remains challenging due to inherent sparsity, technical noise, and the limited availability of high-quality paired measurements. In contrast, large-scale unpaired scRNA-seq datasets often exhibit robust and biologically meaningful cell cluster structures. We introduce Guided Co-clustering Transfer (GuidedCoC) , a novel unsupervised framework that transfers structural knowledge from unpaired scRNA-seq source data to improve both cell clustering and feature alignment in paired scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq target data. GuidedCoC jointly co-clusters cells and features across modalities and domains via a unified information-theoretic objective, aligning gene expression modules with regulatory elements while implicitly performing cross-modal dimensionality reduction to reduce noise. Additionally, it automatically aligns cell types across unpaired and paired datasets without requiring explicit annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GuidedCoC achieves superior clustering accuracy and biological interpretability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the promise of structure-guided, unsupervised transfer learning for robust, scalable, and interpretable integration of single-cell multi-omics data.

Parallelization enables rapid extraction of individual cells into a standardized single-cell image format with fast access to accelerate machine learning. scPortrait enables analysis across modalities including images, proteomics and transcriptomics, identifying cancer-associated macrophage subpopulations by morphology and embedding single-cell images into transcriptome atlases. scPortrait turns microscopy images into a reusable resource for integrative cell modeling, establishing single-cell images as a core modality in systems biology.",

      "abstract": "Since 2014, 47 technologies have been developed to measure multiple biological modalities from the same cells. However, tools for robustly analyzing these data to uncover holistic biological interactions remain limited. Advancing this field could transform research for many disciplines, including human disease and cancer. To address this limitation, we present UniVI ( Uni fied V ariational I nference), a generalizable deep learning algorithm that aligns single-cell measurements from disparate modalities using β —and mixture-of-experts—variational autoencoder frameworks. UniVI learns a latent embedding for each modality while minimizing the divergence between them, a concept often referred to as manifold alignment. Once trained, UniVI enables batch correction, latent factorization, cell-cell alignment, data denoising, and imputation. We demonstrate its performance on multimodal single-cell datasets, including CITE-seq and 10x Multiome data, showing UniVI outperforms widely-used methods without reliance on prior knowledge. This flexibility and generalizability allows UniVI to adapt to emerging multimodal technologies. Our results highlight UniVI’s ability to integrate diverse multimodal and unimodal data, offering a scalable solution for refining biological insights. The unified latent spaces it generates enable exploration of cross-modality correlations and the generation of realistic new data, paving the way for novel discoveries in single-cell biology.",

      "abstract": "Latent factor models are first-line analysis approaches for single- and multi-omics data, essential for data integration, alignment, and biological signal discovery. To cater for new technologies and experimental designs, bespoke extensions of factor models have been proposed, incorporating spatial structure, temporal dynamics and the noise characteristics of single-cell assays. However, the development of tailored methods and software for individual use cases is laborious and requires advanced statistical and domain expertise, posing a significant barrier to users. To address this, we here propose MOFA-FLEX, a flexible and modular factor analysis framework designed for customisable modelling across diverse multi-omics data scenarios. Built on probabilistic programming, MOFA-FLEX unifies previously isolated extensions of factor analysis – including flexible priors, non-negativity constraints, supervision signals, and alternative data likelihoods – allowing models to be configured declaratively without requiring manual engineering. Additionally, MOFA-FLEX features a novel domain knowledge module to inform and connect latent factors to gene programs. We demonstrate MOFA-FLEX across multiple applications, showing (i) improved robustness in recovering gene programs from noisy prior knowledge in scRNA-seq data; (ii) effective disentanglement of technical and biological variation in multi-omic CITE-seq; and (iii) tailored spatial modelling that reveals spatially organised disease-associated gene programs in breast cancer.",

      "title": "CLM-access: A Specialized Foundation Model for High-dimensional Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis",
      "abstract": "Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, cell language models (CLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning cell representations from high-dimensional single-cell data–particularly transcriptomic profiles from scRNA-seq. These foundation models have shown remarkable potential across a variety of downstream applications. However, there remains a lack of foundation models for scATAC-seq data, which measures chromatin accessibility at single-cell level and is critical for decoding epigenetic regulation. Developing such models is considerably more challenging due to the unique characteristics of scATAC-seq data, including the vast number of chromatin regions, lack of standardized annotations, extreme sparsity, and near-binary distributions. To address these challenges, we systematically explore various strategies and propose CLM-access, a specialized foundation model for scATAC-seq data. CLM-access incorporates three main innovations: (1) an unified data processing pipeline that maps 2.8 million cells onto an unified reference of over 1 million chromatin regions; (2) a specialized patching and embedding strategy to effectively manage high-dimensional inputs; and (3) a tailored masking and loss function design that preserves fine-grained regional information while enhancing training efficiency and representation quality. With comprehensive benchmarks, we show that CLM-access significantly outperforms existing methods in key downstream tasks, including batch effect correction, cell type annotation, RNA expression prediction, and multi-modal integration.

      "title": "SensitiveCancerGPT: Leveraging Generative Large Language Model on Structured Omics Data to Optimize Drug Sensitivity Prediction",
      "abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4> The fast accumulation of vast pharmacogenomics data of cancer cell lines provide unprecedented opportunities for drug sensitivity prediction (DSP), a crucial prerequisite for the advancement of precision oncology. Recently, Generative Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated performance and generalization prowess across diverse tasks in the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, the structured format of the pharmacogenomics data poses challenge for the utility of LLM in DSP. Therefore, the objective of this study is multi-fold: to adapt prompt engineering for structured pharmacogenomics data toward optimizing LLM’s DSP performance, to evaluate LLM’s generalization in real-world DSP scenarios, and to compare LLM’s DSP performance against that of state-of-the-science baselines. <h4>Methods</h4> We systematically investigated the capability of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as a DSP model on four publicly available benchmark pharmacogenomics datasets, which are stratified by five cancer tissue types of cell lines and encompass both oncology and non-oncology drugs. Essentially, the predictive landscape of GPT is assessed for effectiveness on the DSP task via four learning paradigms: zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, fine-tuning and clustering pretrained embeddings. To facilitate GPT in seamlessly processing the structured pharmacogenomics data, domain-specific novel prompt engineering is employed by implementing three prompt templates (i.e., Instruction, Instruction-Prefix, Cloze) and integrating pharmacogenomics-related features into the prompt. We validated GPT’s performance in diverse real-world DSP scenarios: cross-tissue generalization, blind tests, and analyses of drug-pathway associations and top sensitive/resistant cell lines. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative evaluation of GPT against multiple Transformer-based pretrained models and existing DSP baselines. <h4>Results</h4> Extensive experiments on the pharmacogenomics datasets across the five tissue cohorts demonstrate that fine-tuning GPT yields the best DSP performance (28% F1 increase, p-value= 0.0003) followed by clustering pretrained GPT embeddings (26% F1 increase, p-value= 0.0005), outperforming GPT in-context learning (i.e., few-shot). However, GPT in the zero-shot setting had a big F1 gap, resulting in the worst performance. Within the scope of prompt engineering, performance enhancement was achieved by directly instructing GPT about the DSP task and resorting to a concise context format (i.e., instruction-prefix), leading to F1 performance gain of 22% (p-value=0.02); while incorporation of drug-cell line prompt context derived from genomics and/or molecular features further boosted F1 score by 2%. Compared to state-of-the-science DSP baselines, GPT significantly asserted superior mean F1 performance (16% gain, p-value<0.05) on the GDSC dataset. In the crosstissue analysis, GPT showcased comparable generalizability to the within-tissue performances on the GDSC and PRISM datasets, while statistically significant F1 performance improvements on the CCLE (8%, p-value=0.001) and DrugComb (19%, p-value=0.009) datasets. Evaluation on the challenging blind tests suggests GPT’s competitiveness on the CCLE and DrugComb datasets compared to random splitting. Furthermore, analyses of the drug-pathway associations and log probabilities provided valuable insights that align with previous DSP findings. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The diverse experiment setups and in-depth analysis underscore the importance of generative LLM, such as GPT, as a viable in silico approach to guide precision oncology. <h4>Availability</h4> https://github.com/bioIKEA/SensitiveCancerGPT",

Existing foundation models for single-cell analysis typically embed cells as continuous vectors, limiting their generative flexibility and hindering integration with the knowledge accumulated in large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present CellTok, a multimodal LLM framework for unified analysis of scRNA-seq data and biological text. Each cell is tokenized into discrete codebook tokens via VQ-VAE and integrated into the LLM’s vocabulary using early fusion. This allows CellTok to process biological and textual inputs autoregressively, leveraging pretrained knowledge within LLMs to analyze cellular states and interactions. CellTok demonstrates strong performance in cell-level tasks such as annotation and generation, and enables previously unattainable large population-level tasks, including accurate prediction of intercellular communication networks, which is a key mechanism in tissue organization and disease.

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  Integration of multimodal, multi-omics data is critical for advancing precision medicine, yet its application is frequently limited by incomplete datasets where one or more modalities are missing. To address this challenge, we developed a generative framework capable of synthesizing any missing modality from an arbitrary subset of available modalities. We introduce Coherent Denoising, a novel ensemble-based generative diffusion method that aggregates predictions from multiple specialized, single-condition models and enforces consensus during the sampling process. We compare this approach against a multicondition, generative model that uses a flexible masking strategy to handle arbitrary subsets of inputs. The results show that our architectures successfully generate high-fidelity data that preserve the complex biological signals required for downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the generated synthetic data can be used to maintain the performance of predictive models on incomplete patient profiles and can leverage counterfactual analysis to guide the prioritization of diagnostic tests. We validated the framework’s efficacy on a large-scale multimodal, multi-omics cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of over 10,000 samples spanning across 20 tumor types, using data modalities such as copy-number alterations (CNA), transcriptomics (RNA-Seq), proteomics (RPPA), and histopathology (WSI). This work establishes a robust and flexible generative framework to address sparsity in multimodal datasets, providing a key step toward improving precision oncology.",

      "abstract": "Foundation models offer new opportunities to capture cellular behavior from large-scale single-cell data. However, their development has been greatly constrained due to the limited availability of multi-omics profiles. Consequently, most models are designed for a single modality (e.g. scRNA-seq, or scATAC-seq, etc.), restricting their ability to capture the diversity of heterogeneous biological systems. Here, we introduce scMomer, a modality-aware pretraining framework designed for multi-modal representation learning under missing modality conditions. scMomer adopts a three-stage pretraining strategy that learns unimodal cell representations, models joint representations from multi-omics data, and distills multi-modal knowledge to enable multi-omics-like representations from unimodal input. Its modality-specific architecture and three-stage pretraining strategy enable effective learning under missing modality conditions and help capture cellular heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, scMomer generates biologically meaningful embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal approaches across diverse gene-level and cell-level downstream tasks, including cross-modality translation, gene function prediction, cell annotation, drug response prediction, and perturbation prediction. Overall, these results demonstrate that scMomer serves as a robust, generalizable, and scalable foundation for single-cell multi-modal analysis under missing modality conditions.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, but machine learning applications in this field face significant challenges, including limited labeled data availability, high dimensionality, and batch effects across different cohorts. To address these limitations, we developed representation learning models for gut microbiome metagenomic data, drawing inspiration from foundation models approaches based on self-supervised and transfer learning principles. By leveraging a large collection of 85,364 metagenomic samples, we implemented multiple self-supervised learning methods, including masked autoencoders with varying masking rates and adapted single-cell RNA sequencing models (scVI and scGPT), to generate embeddings from bacterial abundance profiles. These learned representations demonstrated significant advantages over raw bacterial abundances in two key scenarios: first, when training predictive models with very limited labeled data, improving prediction performance for age (r = 0.14 vs. 0.06), BMI (r = 0.16 vs. 0.11), visceral fat mass (r = 0.25 vs. 0.18), and drug usage classification (PR-AUC = 0.81 vs. 0.73); and second, when generalizing predictions across different cohorts, consistently outperforming models based on raw abundances in cross-dataset evaluation. Our approach provides a valuable framework for leveraging self-supervised representation learning to overcome the data limitations inherent in microbiome research, potentially enabling more robust and generalizable machine learning applications in this field.",

We used transfer learning with high quality single cell ATAC datasets to develop REnformer, a model to predict chromatin accessibility. By introducing a bench-mark for comparing performances against Enformer model, REnformer significantly outperformed Enformer in terms of higher prediction outcomes and lower error rates in all extensive analyses shown; introducing these benchmarks allowed us, and possible future works, to fairly compare such models. We further tested REnformer by predicting the effects of a well characterised α -thalassemia variant and found that the prediction aligned with the observed change in genome regulatory element, previously validated. We conclude that REnformer is and can be a state-of-the-art tool to predict cell type specific regulatory elements, and interrogate the effect of genome variation in health and disease.",

However, existing computational frameworks are constrained by limited scalability and therefore fail to reconcile the growing diversity, dimensionality, and cross-modality heterogeneity inherent in modern spatial omics data. Here, we present GSMO (Generalist Spatial Multi-Omics), a unified Transformer-based architecture for panoramic integration across spatial multi-omics and histology. GSMO establishes a modality-agnostic spatial representation that overcomes the dimensionality bottlenecks of multi-modal fusion, enabling seamless integration of any number and combination of spatial omics modalities with robust scalability and biological fidelity. In a landmark demonstration, GSMO advanced spatial multi-omics integration in an adult EAE mouse brain from the conventional two or three modalities to a record six, encompassing transcriptomics, protein expression, chromatin accessibility, two histone modifications, and histology. The resulting integrative analysis resolved fine-grained anatomical architectures and revealed complementary molecular signals and spatial heterogeneity that remain inaccessible to existing integration approaches. Furthermore, GSMO is released as a user-friendly open-source package that automatically performs data parsing, feature standardization, multi-modal alignment, spatial fusion, and visualization. We anticipate that GSMO will serve as a generalizable and accessible platform for the spatial multi-omics community, enabling deeper exploration of tissue organization, cellular identity, and disease mechanisms across diverse biological systems.</p>",

      "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological cancer characterized by genetic diversity and poor clinical outcomes. Among various genetic mutations in AML, TP53 mutations have relatively low prevalence and present very dismal survival rates. While the genetic features of AML are well understood, the transcriptional programs associated with TP53 dysfunction are less clear, especially across different clinical groups. To fill this gap, we used deep learning on four bulk RNA-seq datasets grouped by p53 expression and a single-cell TARGET-seq dataset classified by TP53 genotype. The bulk data revealed disruptions in chromatin regulation, DNA repair, and immune pathways, with the low-p53 state showing activation of chemokine and interleukin signaling. In the single-cell data, deep learning classifiers successfully distinguished WT from multi-hit TP53-mutant cells, while heterozygous TP53 cells remained transcriptionally similar to WT. Comparing bulk and single-cell results, we found a strong positive correlation between p53-low expression states and TP53-inactive genotypes, linking the expression-based and mutation-based axes of p53 activity. Our study identifies a consistent TP53-related transcriptional signature that connects p53-low expression patterns with underlying TP53 AML.",

This comprehensive review examines the current applications, advancements, and future potential of deep learning technologies across genomic data analysis and pharmaceutical development pipelines. In genomics, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in variant calling and annotation, with tools like DeepVariant achieving superior accuracy in identifying genetic variations, while transformer-based models like Enformer have revolutionized gene expression prediction from DNA sequences. The technology has also advanced epigenomic analysis, single-cell genomics, and functional genomics, enabling researchers to decode complex biological relationships previously inaccessible through traditional methods. In drug discovery, artificial intelligence is transforming every stage of the development pipeline, from target identification and validation to lead optimization and clinical trial design. Deep learning models excel in virtual screening of vast chemical libraries, de novo drug design through generative networks, and prediction of ADMET properties, significantly reducing the time, cost, and risk associated with bringing new therapeutics to market. The synergistic integration of genomic insights with AI-driven drug discovery enables precision medicine approaches, where treatments are tailored to individual genetic profiles. Multi-omics data integration through deep learning provides comprehensive disease understanding and facilitates the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. Despite remarkable progress, several challenges persist, including data availability and quality issues, model interpretability concerns, generalizability limitations, and ethical considerations surrounding privacy and algorithmic bias. Future directions include advanced multi-modal integration, reinforcement learning for drug design, digital twin technologies for personalized medicine, and the potential integration of quantum computing with AI.

Here, we present Garfield (Graph-based Contrastive Learning Enables Fast Single-Cell Embedding), a geometric deep-learning framework that addresses these challenges through spatially or molecularly aware cell embedding.

We further demonstrate Garfield's versatility by applying it to multimodal spatial data, including gene expression and chromatin accessibility, where it successfully identifies distinct niches in the mouse brain. Notably, Garfield reveals tumor microenvironment heterogeneity in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, uncovered conserved, barrier-like immune niches at tumor margins orchestrating CD80-mediated T cell-B cell-dendritic cell interactions and IFN-y/B cell activation pathways, forming spatially coordinated immune surveillance hubs.

      "abstract": "Cellular states are strongly influenced by spatial context, but single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) loses information about local tissue organization, while spatial proteomic assays capture limited marker panels that constrain transcriptomic inference. Integrating these modalities can elucidate how spatial niches shape transcriptional programs, yet existing approaches depend on either feature-level correspondence such as gene–protein linkage or cell-level barcode pairing, which is often unavailable. We present ARCADIA (ARchetype-based Clustering and Alignment with Dual Integrative Autoencoders), a generative framework for cross-modal integration that operates without cell barcode pairing and does not assume direct feature-to-feature correspondence. ARCADIA identifies modality-specific archetypes, i.e., convex combinations of cells representing extreme phenotypic states, and aligns these archetype anchors across modalities by minimizing the discrepancy between their cell-type composition profiles. The aligned archetypes define a shared coordinate system that anchors a pair of dual variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained with cross-modal geometric regularization, preserving archetype structure and spatial neighborhood information while enabling bidirectional translation between modalities. On a semi-synthetic benchmark derived from paired CITE-seq and synthetic spatial grids, ARCADIA accurately recapitulates cell-type correspondences and spatially dependent subpopulation structures, outperforming existing weak-linkage methods. Applied to independent human tonsil scRNA-seq and CODEX data, ARCADIA reconstructs known tissue architecture and reveals spatially dependent transcriptional programs linking B-cell maturation and T-cell activation or exhaustion to their microenvironmental niches. <h4>Availability</h4>  All data analyzed in this work have been previously published and are available in the original studies.

      "abstract": "Tumor morphological features from histology images are a cornerstone of clinical pathology, diagnostic biomarkers, and basic cancer biology research. Spatial transcriptomics, which provides spatially resolved gene expression profiles overlaid on histology images, offers a unique opportunity to integrate morphological and expression features, thereby deepening our understanding of tumor biology. However, spatial transcriptomics experiments with patient samples in either clinical trials or clinical care are costly and challenging, whereas histology images are generated routinely and available for many legacy prospective cohorts of disease progression and outcomes in well-annotated cohorts. Inferring spatial transcriptomics profiles computationally from these histology images would significantly expand our understanding of tumor biology, but paired data for training multi-modal spatial-histology models remains limited. Here, we tackle this challenge by incorporating performant foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets of pathology images and single-cell RNA-Seq, respectively, which provide useful embeddings to underpin multi-modal models. To this end, we developed PathOmCLIP, a model trained with contrastive loss to create a joint-embedding space between a histopathology foundation model and a single-cell RNA-seq foundation model. We incorporate a set transformer to gather localized neighborhood tumor architecture following contrastive training, which further enhances performance and is necessary to obtain robust results. We validate PathOmCLIP across five tumor types and achieve significant performance improvements in gene expression prediction tasks over other methods. PathOmCLIP can be applied to many archived histology images, unlocking valuable clinical information and facilitating new biomarker discoveries.",

      "abstract": "The integration of multi-modal genomic data, encompassing sequences, annotations, and coverage tracks, remains a major bottleneck in bioinformatics, both for exploratory data analysis and machine learning applications. Current approaches rely on several specialized tools for different data modalities, leading to inefficient workflows and computational overhead. Here, we present momics, a unified framework to consolidate multi-omics data in a single repository and interrogate it with a high-performance query engine. Compared to existing tools, momics ingests genomic sequences, feature annotations, and unlimited coverage tracks into TileDB-backed repositories, and provides a scalable query engine for concurrent multi-modal queries across millions of genomic loci. Our benchmarks demonstrate up to 20-fold better data compression and up to 100-fold speed improvements over standard tools like pyBigWig, with a sublinear time complexity ideal for large-scale queries. Momics provides a python library optimized for exploratory data analysis and machine learning workflows, natively supporting current state-of-the-art bioinformatic ecosystems and cloud storage systems. We demonstrate momics’ utility through two real-world applications: (1) multi-modal data integration of hundreds of ChIP-seq datasets together with genomic sequence, and (2) multi-modal deep learning for chromatin accessibility prediction. By eliminating the need for multiple data parsing tools and providing a unified interface for all genomic data types, momics represents a paradigm shift in how large-scale multi-omics data can be managed and analyzed. <h4>Key points</h4>  momics is a unified framework to consolidate sequences, annotations, and coverage tracks into a single queryable repository, addressing the critical bottleneck in genomic data analysis where researchers must juggle multiple specialized tools for different data modalities. We show that momics can achieve up to 20-fold better data compression and 100-fold speed improvements over standard tools, with sublinear time complexity when querying millions of genomic positions simultaneously. We use momics to formally demonstrate that multi-modal deep learning models can outperform single-modality approaches in predicting chromatin accessibility, achieving correlation of 0.84 when training with a combination of genomic sequence and MNase data. Our results establish a new paradigm for reproducible multi-omics modeling, where entire multi-omics analysis workflows from data storage to machine learning model training can be replicated.",

      "abstract": "Cancer cells display highly heterogeneous and plastic states in glioblastoma, an incurable brain tumour. However, how these malignant states arise and whether they follow defined cellular trajectories across tumours is poorly understood. Here, we generated a deep single cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of human glioblastoma that pairs transcriptomic, epigenomic and genomic profiling of 12 tumours across multiple regions. We identify that glioblastoma heterogeneity is driven by spatially-patterned transitions of cancer cells from developmental-like states towards those defined by a glial injury response and hypoxia. This cellular trajectory regionalises tumours into distinct tissue niches and manifests in a molecularly conserved manner across tumours as well as genetically distinct tumour subclones. Moreover, using a new deep learning framework to map cancer cell states jointly with clones in situ , we show that tumour subclones are finely spatially intermixed through glioblastoma tissue niches. Finally, we show that this cancer cell trajectory is intimately linked to myeloid heterogeneity and unfolds across regionalised myeloid signalling environments. Our findings define a stereotyped trajectory of cancer cells in glioblastoma and unify glioblastoma tumour heterogeneity into a tractable cellular and tissue framework.",

OpenDVP integrates open-source software for image analysis, including MCMICRO, QuPath, and Napari, and uses the scverse data formats AnnData and SpatialData for multi-omics integration. It offers two workflows: a fast-track pipeline requiring no image analysis expertise and an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered pipeline with recent algorithms for image pre-processing, segmentation, and spatial analysis. We demonstrate openDVP’s versatility in three archival tissue studies, profiling human placenta, early-stage lung cancer, and locally relapsed breast cancer. In each study, our framework provided insights into health and disease states by integrating spatial single-cell phenotypes with exploratory proteomic data. Finally, we introduce deep proteomic profiling of cellular neighborhoods as a scalable approach to accelerate spatial discovery proteomics across biological systems.",

To address this challenge, we introduce Qimai, a modular AI agent framework that integrates deep learning predictions with biological evidence using Large Language Model (LLM) as reasoning engine. Qimai combines direct motif evidence from the query protein, indirect motif evidence from its interactors, and quantitative prediction from a new transformer-based DPI model to produce explainable predictions with confidence scores. On a benchmark of 78 unseen proteins, Qimai consistently outperforms standalone deep learning models across all metrics, increasing the Area Under Curve of the Precision-Recall (AUC-PR), the Area Under Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) by 17.6%, 15.6%, and 244% respectively compared to the best standalone model. Ablation analyses reveal that this gain is driven by the LLM’s ability to dynamically weigh diverse evidence, with indirect motif evidence of co-factors particularly critical for unseen proteins. Qimai establishes a generalizable and interpretable paradigm for integrating heterogeneous data in predictive genomics.

To address this problem, we generated a uniformly pre-processed Consensus Pituitary Atlas (CPA) using all existing mouse pituitary single-cell datasets (267 biological replicates, >1.1 million high-quality cells). The CPA revealed novel cell typing and lineage markers, including low-expression transcripts that previous analyses could not detect. The scale of the CPA enabled the development of machine learning models to automate and standardize cell type annotation and doublet identification for future studies. Leveraging the curated metadata, we identified sex-biased and age-dependent gene expression patterns at cell type resolution. To identify drivers of cell fates, first we determined consensus cell communication patterns. Secondly, we used RNA-sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to identify transcription factors associated with cell fates across modalities.

      "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) has reshaped biomedical research, enabling the high-resolution characterization of cellular populations. Yet cell type annotation, a process typically performed by domain experts interpreting gene expression patterns by manual curation or with specialized algorithms, remains labor-intensive and limited by prior knowledge. In addition, while reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on mathematics, coding and general-reasoning benchmarks, their potential in scRNAseq analyses remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the advantages and limitations of employing DeepSeek-R1-0528, a recently developed open-source 671B-parameter reasoning LLM, for zero-shot scRNAseq cell type annotation. We find that DeepSeek-R1 prompted with a ranked list of 10 differentially expressed marker genes per cluster of single cells outperforms both its reasoning-enhanced, non-reasoning equivalent (DeepSeek-V3-0324) and GPT-4o in cluster-level annotations. At the level of single cells, DeepSeek-R1 prompted with the top 500 expressed genes in a cell outperforms its non-reasoning counterpart DeepSeek-V3, illustrating test-time scaling for bioinformatics tasks through natural language. Running DeepSeek-R1 in zero-shot classifier mode, with a prompt that presents a broad catalogue of cell type labels to choose from, improves its performance and generalizability across different datasets. On data curated by the expert model scTab (termed in-domain data), the DeepSeek-R1 classifiers perform better than the expert model scGPT and on par with the specialized cell genomics LLM C2S-Scale-1B, but lag behind scTab. On out-of-distribution data unseen by the two expert models, DeepSeek-R1 and its classifier versions generalize better and outperform the other models in the majority of the evaluated datasets. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 supports its cell type calls with interpretable textual biological rationales underlying its reasoning, providing a learning opportunity for researchers. Nevertheless, peak annotation performance remains modest, highlighting the intrinsic complexity of scRNAseq cell type annotation.",

      "abstract": "Investigating accurate cancer survival prediction models has important clinical value for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Although an increasing number of models have shifted from relying solely on clinical variables to integrating multi-omics data, there remains insufficient exploitation and integrative utilization of gene regulatory network (GRN) structures and cancer subtype information, which limits the predictive accuracy and biological interpretability of multi-omics models. Therefore, this study proposes label-aware and graph-guided multi-omics collaborative learning framework, termed LaCONIC, to achieve accurate and interpretable cancer survival prediction. To obtain biologically meaningful regulatory features of different molecular types, we first construct a gene regulatory network comprising multiple molecular entities and their relations, and design a heterogeneous graph self-supervised pre-training module to obtain unified graph-based gene representations. To fully leverage multiomics and multi-modal information, we develop an adaptive cross-omics representation learning module that performs intraomics modality alignment (i.e., graph and expression modals) and inter-omics representation alignment, thereby achieving synergistic integration of multi-source information. Moreover, to comprehensively capture global cross-omics molecular interactions, we present a graph-guided cross-omics interactive learning module that explicitly encodes gene regulatory network priors within a Transformer-based architecture. Finally, we introduce cancer subtype information to construct a label-aware constraint mechanism that improves predictive performance while enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class consistency of the learned representations. Experiments on multiple cancer datasets show that LaCONIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various metrics. SHAP-based interpretability analysis on breast cancer further identifies survival-associated regulatory modules and high-risk molecules (e.g., hsa-miR-148a-3p, ARMC1, TMEM242), highlighting its potential for biological mechanism elucidation and prognostic assessment.

Here, we propose scstGCN, a multimodal information fusion method based on Vision Transformer (ViT) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that integrates histological images, spot-based spatial transcriptomics data and spatial location information to infer super-resolution gene expression profiles at single-cell level. We evaluated the accuracy of the super-resolution gene expression profiles generated on diverse tissue ST datasets with disease and healthy by scstGCN along with their performance in identifying spatial patterns, conducting functional enrichment analysis, and tissue annotation. The results show that scstGCN can predict super-resolution gene expression accurately, aid researchers in discovering biologically meaningful differentially expressed genes and pathways. Additionally, scstGCN can segment and annotate tissues at a finer granularity, with results demonstrating strong consistency with coarse manual annotations. <h4>Key Points</h4> scstGCN combines multi-modal information including histology image, spot-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, and physical spatial location through deep learning methods to achieve single-cell resolution of spot-based ST data without requiring single-cell references. scstGCN employs GCN to capture complex relationships between neighboring cells, facilitating the integration of multimodal feature information based on single-cell level, and then accurately infers single-cell resolution spatial gene expression. scstGCN can infer single-cell resolution gene expression across the entire tissue region.

However, current tools employing variational inference on single-cell datasets, including methods for paired and mosaic integration, transfer learning, and modality imputation, typically act as black boxes. This lack of interpretability makes it challenging to evaluate whether biological variation is preserved, which can compromise downstream analyses. Here, we introduce NetworkVI, a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data. NetworkVI utilizes biological prior knowledge as an inductive bias, specifically it relies on gene-gene interactions inferred from topologically associated domains and structured ontologies like the Gene Ontology to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and subcellular level. While achieving state-of-the-art data integration, modality imputation, and cell label transfer via query-to-reference mapping benchmarks across bimodal and trimodal datasets, NetworkVI additionally excels in providing biologically meaningful modality- and cell type-specific interpretations. NetworkVI aids researchers in identifying associations between genes and biological processes and uncovers immune evasion mechanisms in a Perturb CITE-seq dataset of melanoma cells. NetworkVI will support researchers in interpreting cellular disease mechanisms, guiding biomarker discovery, and ultimately aiding the development of targeted therapies in large-scale single-cell multimodal atlases.

This approach mitigates technical variation while preserving lineage boundaries and continuous trajectories, producing unsupervised clusters consistent with expert annotations. A semi-supervised variant, supBIOT, leverages partial labels to enhance cell-type resolution and cross-dataset consistency. Across multi-batch single-cell RNA sequencing benchmarks, scBIOT matches or outperforms leading integration methods without collapsing related subtypes, and the architecture generalizes to single-nucleus ATAC-seq and multimodal data with minimal adaptation. By integrating geometry-aware alignment with long-range feature modeling, scBIOT provides a scalable, modality-agnostic framework for high-resolution single-cell integration and analysis.</p>",

To address this limitation, we introduce a structured, human–guided, multi-stage computational AI agent SPI-WSI, that iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines biologically informative natural-language prompts, thereby localizing bulk-derived pathway activity within histopathology slides. Our pipeline uses in-context prompting in large language models (LLMs) to adapt dynamically to the task of prompt generation. Candidate prompts are first produced by the LLM and then subjected to a secondary pathologist critiquing by the same LLM that cross-references PubMed to ensure both biological plausibility and specificity. Each approved prompt against their image tile is scored using the vision language foundation model (CONCH). We benchmarked different LLMs, Gemini 2.0, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3.7 and Claude 4.0, and found that Claude 4.0 achieves the highest cosine similarity (0.7) between image and prompt embeddings. Pathologist-driven scoring and manual segmentation confirm that our method accurately identifies clusters of spatial pathological morphologies. In addition, we have validated the method against ground-truth spatial transcriptomic spots using inhouse and public datasets. Overall, the trend emphasized by ground-truth spatial RNA sequencing prompts is closely aligned with those from bulk prompt.

Similarly, in single-cell genomics (SCG), representation learning is well-recognized for offering insights into complex biological data, even more so by the advent of early foundation model approaches. However, despite these advancements, identifying scenarios in SCG where SSL outperforms traditional supervised or unsupervised learning methods remains a nuanced challenge. Furthermore, selecting the most effective pretext tasks within the SSL framework for SCG is a critical yet unresolved question. Here, we address this gap by adapting and benchmarking SSL techniques in SCG, including masked autoencoders with multiple masking strategies and contrastive learning approaches. Trained on over 20 million cells, this study rigorously examines multiple downstream tasks, including cell type prediction, gene expression reconstruction, cross-modality prediction, and data integration. Our empirical analyses underscore the nuanced role of SSL, namely in transfer learning scenarios leveraging auxiliary data or analyzing novel datasets. Masked autoencoders excel over contrastive methods in SCG, diverging from computer vision trends. Moreover, our findings reveal notable capabilities of SSL in zero-shot cell type prediction and offer insights into its potential benefits in cross-modality prediction and data integration. In summary, we study the application of SSL in SCG, minimizing model bias through simple, fully connected networks, and benchmark SSL's utility across key representation learning scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The expansion of the neocortex is a hallmark of human evolution and is closely linked to neural stem cell biology. Yet, the epigenetic mechanisms driving divergent gene regulation during primate neurogenesis remain elusive. Here, we comprehensively mapped 3D genome organization, chromatin accessibility and gene expression in induced pluripotent stem cells and derived neural stem cells from human, chimpanzee, gorilla and macaque. We identified human-specific epigenetic signatures including cis-regulatory regions and enhancer-promoter interactions and linked them to gene regulatory dynamics. Deep learning models revealed that complex regulatory grammar at cis-regulatory regions, including transcription factor binding sites, local context and higher-order chromatin organization, underlies species and cell type-specific differences. High-resolution Hi-C uncovered unexpected global shifts in 3D genome architecture in chimpanzee and gorilla neural stem cells while topologically associating domains remain remarkably conserved. Notably, species-specific genes interacted with multiple differentially accessible regions, suggesting that synergistic enhancer activation is a key mechanism driving epigenome evolution. These findings provide new insights into the epigenetic basis of primate brain evolution.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Ischaemic heart disease is a global healthcare challenge with high morbidity and mortality. Early revascularisation in acute myocardial infarction has improved survival, however, limited regenerative capacity and microvascular dysfunction often lead to impaired function and the development of heart failure. New mechanistic insights are required to identify robust targets for the development of novel strategies to promote regeneration. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled profiling and analysis of the transcriptomes of individual cells at high resolution. Applications of scRNA-seq have generated single cell atlases for multiple species, revealed distinct cellular compositions for different regions of the heart, and defined multiple mechanisms involved in myocardial injury-induced regeneration. In this review, we summarise findings from studies of healthy and injured hearts in multiple species and spanning different developmental stages. Based on this transformative technology, we propose a multi-species, multi-omics, meta-analysis framework to drive the discovery of new targets to promote cardiovascular regeneration.</p>",

While spatial multi-omics approaches offer unprecedented insights into complex biological systems, their widespread adoption is hindered by technical challenges, specialized requirements, and limited accessibility. To address these limitations, we present NicheTrans, the first spatially-aware cross-omics translation method and a flexible Transformer-based multi-modal deep learning framework. Unlike existing single-cell (non-spatial) translation methods, NicheTrans uniquely incorporates both cellular microenvironment information and flexible integration of multi-modal data, such as morphology and prior knowledge. We validated NicheTrans across diverse biological cases: Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), breast cancer, and lymph nodes. Our approach demonstrated superior performance compared to existing single-cell methods, highlighting the crucial role of spatial and multi-modal information in cross-omics translation. Through NicheTrans, we uncovered spatial multi-omics domains that were not detectable through single-omics analysis alone. Model interpretation revealed key molecular relationships, including gene programs associated with dopamine metabolism and amyloid β-associated cell states. Additionally, using translated protein markers as spatial landmarks, we quantified the spatial organization of key glial cell subtypes in the AD brain. NicheTrans represents a powerful tool for generating comprehensive spatial multi-omics insights from more accessible single-omics measurements, making multi-omics analysis more feasible for the broader research community.",

      "abstract": "Modern biomedical research generates vast, multi-modal datasets (multi-omics) from the same patient cohorts, offering an unprecedented opportunity to understand complex diseases. However, integrating these heterogeneous data views to predict clinical outcomes like patient survival presents significant statistical challenges. These challenges include data heterogeneity, high dimensionality, inherent zero-inflation due to technical dropouts or biological absence, and the need to incorporate prior biological knowledge. We propose the Bayesian Multi-view Graph Convolutional Network (BMGCN), a deep generative framework designed to address these challenges. BMGCN factorizes the data into shared and view-specific latent representations, enabling both data integration and the identification of view-specific signals. It employs graph-convolutional encoders to integrate prior biological network knowledge, a zero-inflated likelihood to accurately model sparse omics data, and a spike-and-slab prior for Bayesian view selection to identify modalities most relevant to the outcome. Finally, a semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards module allows the model to handle right-censored survival data directly. We detail the full generative model, derive the variational inference objective, and outline a comprehensive validation strategy. BMGCN provides a powerful, interpretable, and flexible framework for integrative multi-omics analysis.",

Here, we use a systems biology approach to derive a signature of the main sources of heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) from lung cancer transcriptomic data. We demonstrate that this signature, which we called iHet , is conserved in different cancers and associated with antitumor immunity. Through the analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, we trace back the cellular origin of the variability that explains the iHet signature. Finally, we demonstrate that iHet has predictive value for cancer immunotherapy, which can be further improved by disentangling three major determinants of anticancer immune responses: activity of immune cells, immune infiltration or exclusion, and cancer-cell foreignness. This work shows how transcriptomics data can be integrated to derive a holistic representation of the phenotypic heterogeneity of the TME, and ultimately to determine its unfolding and fate during immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockers.",

Here, we introduce sciL-aMA (single-cell interpretable Language Model Adapter), a novel representation learning frame-work that bridges these gaps by integrating static gene embeddings from multimodal LLMs with scRNA-seq tabular data through a paired-VAE architecture. Our approach generates context-aware representations for both cells and genes and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key single-cell downstream tasks, including batch effect correction, cell clustering, and cell-state-specific gene marker and module identification, while maintaining computational efficiency. sciL-aMA offers a computationally efficient, unified framework for comprehensive single-cell data analysis and biologically interpretable gene module discovery.

      "abstract": "The advent of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology makes it possible for re-searchers to leverage multiple modalities for individual cells and explore cell heterogeneity. However, the high dimensional, discrete, and sparse nature of the data make the downstream analysis particularly challenging. Most of the existing computational methods for single-cell data analysis are either limited to single modality or lack flexibility and interpretability. In this study, we propose an interpretable deep learning method called multi-omic embedded topic model (moETM) to effectively perform integrative analysis of high-dimensional single-cell multimodal data. moETM integrates multiple omics data via a product-of-experts in the encoder for efficient variational inference and then employs multiple linear decoders to learn the multi-omic signatures of the gene regulatory programs. Through comprehensive experiments on public single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data (i.e., scRNA+scATAC), as well as scRNA and proteomic data (i.e., CITE-seq), moETM demonstrates superior performance compared with six state-of-the-art single-cell data analysis methods on seven publicly available datasets. By applying moETM to the scRNA+scATAC data in human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), we identified sequence motifs corresponding to the transcription factors that regulate immune gene signatures. Applying moETM analysis to CITE-seq data from the COVID-19 patients revealed not only known immune cell-type-specific signatures but also composite multi-omic biomarkers of critical conditions due to COVID-19, thus providing insights from both biological and clinical perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Lung neuroendocrine tumours (NETs, also known as carcinoids) are rapidly rising in incidence worldwide but have unknown aetiology and limited therapeutic options beyond surgery. We conducted multi-omic analyses on over 300 lung NETs including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), transcriptome profiling, methylation arrays, spatial RNA sequencing, and spatial proteomics. The integration of multi-omic data provides definitive proof of the existence of four strikingly different molecular groups that vary in patient characteristics, genomic and transcriptomic profiles, microenvironment, and morphology, as much as distinct diseases. Among these, we identify a new molecular group, enriched for highly aggressive supra-carcinoids, that displays an immune-rich microenvironment linked to tumour—macrophage crosstalk, and we uncover an undifferentiated cell population within supra-carcinoids, explaining their molecular and behavioural link to high-grade lung neuroendocrine carcinomas. Deep learning models accurately identified the Ca A1, Ca A2, and Ca B groups based on morphology alone, outperforming current histological criteria. The characteristic tumour microenvironment of supra-carcinoids and the validation of a panel of immunohistochemistry markers for the other three molecular groups demonstrates that these groups can be accurately identified based solely on morphological features, facilitating their implementation in the clinical setting. Our proposed morpho-molecular classification highlights group-specific therapeutic opportunities, including DLL3, FGFR, TERT, and BRAF inhibitors. Overall, our findings unify previously proposed molecular classifications and refine the lung cancer map by revealing novel tumour types and potential treatments, with significant implications for prognosis and treatment decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Single-cell multi-omics technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to decipher complex cellular mechanisms. To overcome experimental limitations in scale, cost, and coverage, powerful computational methods are essential for integrating diverse data modalities and generating high-fidelity in-silico data. In this paper, we present scDiffusion-X, a latent diffusion model specifically designed for this purpose. The core innovation is a Dual-Cross-Attention (DCA) module that adaptively learns intricate, hidden relationships between different molecular modalities, offering a more flexible and interpretable approach than traditional integration strategies. Extensive benchmarking experiments demonstrate that scDiffusion-X excels at generating realistic multi-omics data, preserving cellular heterogeneity and global data structures with excellent scalability. Distinct from existing multi-omics simulators, scDiffusion-X uniquely enables high-fidelity modality translation by predicting one molecular modality from another and provides robust uncertainty quantification. Beyond data generation, we designed a gradient-based interpretation framework to transform DCA module into a discovery tool, enabling inference of comprehensive cell-type-specific heterogeneous gene regulatory networks (GRNs). By integrating state-of-the-art generative modeling with deep biological interpretability, scDiffusion-X serves as a powerful tool for dissecting regulatory relationships, predicting perturbation responses, poised to accelerate discovery in single-cell multi-omics research.",

      "title": "Toward a privacy-preserving predictive foundation model of single-cell transcriptomics with federated learning and tabular modeling",
      "abstract": "The ability to pre-train on vast amounts of data to build foundation models (FMs) has achieved remarkable success in numerous domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and, more recently, single-cell genomics—epitomized by GeneFormer, scGPT, and scFoundation. However, as single-cell FMs begin to train on increasingly large corpora, significant privacy and ethical concerns arise. Moreover, unlike text data, single-cell data is unordered and exhibits a unique tabular structure that most existing single-cell FMs overlook. In this study, we propose Tabula, a privacy-preserving and tabular-structure aware FM designed with federated learning (FL) and tabular modeling. Tabula combines the advantages of FMs and FL, enabling collaborative model training across multiple clients without compromising data privacy. In contrast to earlier single-cell FMs—which treat single-cell data like natural language (viewing cells as “words” defined by genes)—Tabula introduces a novel pretraining strategy that explicitly models the tabular structure of single-cell data. Extensive experimental results show that Tabula outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks (including cell type annotation, gene imputation, gene perturbation, multi-batch integration, and multi-omics integration) while requiring only half the data for pretraining and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, Tabula accurately reveals pairwise and even combinatorial regulatory logic across diverse biological systems, including hematopoiesis, pancreatic endogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiogenesis. Thus, Tabula provides a new foundation model that explicitly incorporates the tabular nature of single-cell data alongside FL, paving the way for creating a “virtual cell” for human health under critical privacy preservation.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Female reproductive aging is a complex process with profound systemic health implications, yet the molecular and structural dynamics of aging across reproductive organs and tissues remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate deep learning-based analysis of 1,112 histological images with RNA-seq data from 659 samples across seven reproductive organs in 304 female donors aged 20-70 years. We show that female reproductive organs and tissues have asynchronous aging dynamics: while the ovary and vagina age gradually, the uterus undergoes an abrupt transcriptional and cellular transition around the age of menopause. Tissue segmentation highlights that the myometrium in the uterine wall is the most age-affected tissue, marked by extracellular matrix remodeling and immune activation. Across reproductive organs, the epithelial tissue is also strongly affected by age, with the vaginal epithelium showing a unique sharp menopausal transition. Integration via multi-omics factor analysis links these tissue-specific histological transformations to specific molecular shifts, many with nonlinear expression trajectories and enriched in heritable reproductive traits such as pelvic organ prolapse and age at menarche. These findings position menopause as a key inflection point in female aging and provide insights with tissue-specific focus to support healthier menopausal transitions and reduce age-related disease risk.",

      "abstract": "<h4>SUMMARY</h4> The immune composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has a major impact on the therapeutic response and clinical outcome in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we comprehensively characterize the TME at the single-cell level by first building a large-scale atlas that integrates 4.27 million single cells from 1,670 patient samples. We then complemented the atlas with single-cell profiles from four CRC cohorts with 266 patients, including cells with low mRNA content, spatial transcriptional profiles from 3.7 million cells, and protein profiles from 0.7 million cells. The analysis of the atlas allows refined tumor classification into four immune phenotypes: immune desert, B cell enriched, T cell enriched, and myeloid cell enriched subtypes. Within the myeloid compartment we uncover distinct subpopulations of neutrophils that acquire new functional properties in blood and in the TME, including anti-tumorigenic capabilities. Further, spatial multimodal single-cell profiling reveals that neutrophils are organized in clusters within distinct functional niches. Finally, using an orthotopic mouse model we show that cancer-derived systemic signals modify neutrophil production in the bone marrow, providing evidence for tumor-induced granulopoiesis. Our study provides a big data resource for the CRC and suggests novel therapeutic strategies targeting neutrophils.",

      "abstract": "Uncontrolled proliferation is a hallmark of cancer, yet tumour cells can enter G0 arrest by halting the cell cycle reversibly (quiescence) or irreversibly (senescence) to survive under stress and in hostile tumour microenvironments (TME). G0 arrested cells contribute to drug tolerance, metastasis and recurrence, but their identification remains challenging due to their rarity and elusive regulatory pathways. Here, we quantify G0 arrest and proliferation decisions in single-cell and spatially profiled breast primary tumours to unveil adaptive responses driving immune compartmentalisation. We identify a genomically-constrained and prolonged G0 arrest state resembling that of dormant precursors of cancer progression. This state featured adaptive transcriptional reprogramming, including unfolded protein response stress, reduced mitochondrial translation and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity enabled by semaphorin signalling. Spatial transcriptomics revealed G0 arrest pockets encapsulated by APOE + lipid-associated macrophages, myofibroblastic CAFs and immature perivascular cells, suggestive of an immunosuppressive niche contrasting with cytotoxic environments in proliferative hotspots and displaying distinct drug sensitivities. To facilitate future research, we provide a foundation model capturing G0 arrest and proliferation with 94% accuracy in single cell data, available at https://github.com/secrierlab/G0-LM . Our findings provide new insights into the spatial organisation of cell cycle arrest in breast cancer, highlighting the role of G0 states in tumour heterogeneity and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "The marked heterogeneity of cancer poses a substantial challenge to precision drug therapy, resulting in considerable variability in patient responses to identical treatments. Accurately predicting drug sensitivity thus represents an urgent and critical challenge in the field of pharmacology and personalized medicine. Existing methods have limitations in addressing the complexity of multi-modal biological data and heterogeneous graphs. Additionally, their heavy reliance on labeled data hinders model generalization. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Dual-Perturbation Contrastive Learning Network for Drug Response Prediction (HGACL-DRP). This framework constructs an optimized heterogeneous graph structure by integrating multi-omics features and implementing a robust neighbor filtering mechanism. HGACL-DRP innovatively introduces a Dual-Perturbation contrastive learning paradigm that incorporates both feature and structural perturbations specifically designed for drug response prediction, thereby enabling the self-supervised learning of more robust heterogeneous graph node embeddings. On two major public datasets, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), HGACL-DRP exhibits exceptional performance across multiple classification metrics, achieving a mean AUC of 95.48% on CCLE and 98.99% on GDSC. Compared to existing state-of-the-art drug response prediction algorithms, HGACL-DRP demonstrates statistically significant improvements in predictive accuracy. The innovative multi-view graph augmentation strategy and attention mechanism are designed to enhance personalized drug selection and facilitate novel drug discovery. HGACL-DRP is anticipated to address the challenges posed by drug response heterogeneity, thereby providing reliable support for clinical decision-making.",

Lining fibroblasts display induction of antigen-presentation and IL-6/JAK–STAT pathways, while a CHI3L1-producing fibroblast population arises specifically in RA and may act as a source of autoantigens. These stromal populations interact closely with FABP5⁺ iDC3 cells and T cells within a disrupted synovial lining, creating a niche driving adaptive immune activation.

      "abstract": "In addressing the limitations of current multimodal analysis methods that largely ignore phenotypic data, leading to a lack of biological interpretability at the phenotypic level, we developed the Single-Cell and Tissue Phenotype prediction (SCTP), a deep-learning-based multimodal fusion framework. SCTP can simultaneously detect phenotype-specific cells and characterize the tumor microenvironment of pathological tissue by integrating essential information from the bulk sample phenotype, the composition of individual cells, and the spatial distribution of cells. Upon evaluating SCTP’s efficiency and robustness against traditional analytical methods, we developed a specialized model, SCTP-CRC, tailored for colorectal cancer (CRC). This model integrates RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomic data to offer a better understanding of CRC. SCTP-CRC has proven effective in accurately identifying tumor-associated cells and clusters and continuously defines boundary regions as well as the spatial organization of the entire tumor microenvironment. This enables a detailed depiction of cellular communication networks, capturing the dynamic shifts that occur during tumor progression. Furthermore, SCTP-CRC extends to the identification of abnormal sub-regions in the early state of CRC and uncovers potential early-warning signature genes such as MMP2, IGKC, and PIGR. These biomarkers are not only important in recognizing the onset of CRC but may also play a crucial role in differentiating between CRC-derived liver metastases and primary liver tumors. SCTP stands as a transformative framework, offering a deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment through its ability to quantitatively characterize cancer’s fundamental traits and dissect the intricate molecular and cellular interactions at play. This comprehensive insight supports the early diagnosis and enables personalized treatment strategies, marking a significant stride toward improving patient outcomes and tailoring therapies to individual disease profiles.",

Using a transformer trained from scratch, we evaluate tokenization strategies for cell type classification across challenging transfer learning settings – cross-tissue, cross-species, and spatial gene-panel shifts – and separately assess reverse perturbation prediction. Tokenization choices show minimal impact in-distribution but are decisive under distribution shift, with  F G and  order driving the largest gains and  F E providing additional improvements.

In order to accurately understand the disease mechanism, multimodal signals should be considered. Spectroomics is widely used in medical research as a fast, simple and non-invasive optical analysis technology. It is a new “omics” emerging after genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. Effectively fusing the information carried by different omics can better predict diseases. In this paper, we design a novel Cross-modal Cross-fusion network (CMACF) based on Transformer self-attention mechanism. Importantly, we observe that the interaction between any two pairwise modalities is different and does not contribute equally to the final disease prediction. Through multiple interaction stages, the features of Raman-infrared spectroscopy, Raman-metabolomics and infrared spectrum-metabolomics were reasonably focused, and the cross-fusion strategy and long sequence decision model were used to obtain the overall correlation of multi-omics features. We conduct extensive experiments on the systemic lupus erythematosus disease multi-omics dataset, and the accuracy and AUC values are 99.44% and 99.98%, respectively, which have the best classification effect. The results show that CMACF has outstanding and stable prediction performance, which is of great reference value for the diagnosis of SLE patients and can explain the contribution of multimodal fusion of multi-omics data.",

      "abstract": "Biological tissues are composed of distinct microenvironments that spatially orchestrate gene expression and cell identity. However, the regulatory principles governing domain-specific cellular functions remain poorly understood due to the lack of effective methods for mapping gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in situ . To address this gap, we introduce STARNet, a representation learning approach that leverages heterogeneous hypergraph modeling of spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic data to resolve tissue-domain–specific regulatory interactions. By integrating graph neural networks with contrastive learning in a self-supervised framework, STARNet learns unified embeddings that preserve both multi-modal molecular features and anatomical spatial context, enabling accurate and domain-resolved GRN reconstruction within complex tissues. Benchmarking on both simulated and real datasets demonstrates that STARNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate its broad applicability across diverse biological contexts, including neural development, genetic disease risk, and drug-induced developmental toxicity. In the mouse brain, it delineates region-specific regulatory networks and reconstructs spatiotemporal programs underlying neural stem cell differentiation. In human genetics, it provides a mechanistic link between genotypes and phenotypes by showing how genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for complex diseases perturb hippocampus-specific GRNs. In developmental toxicology, STARNet reveals that drug-induced disruptions of GRNs in defined embryonic regions underlie tissue-specific vulnerability. Collectively, STARNet offers a powerful and versatile framework for resolving the spatial regulatory logic of complex tissues, providing multi-angle insights into tissue patterning, development, and disease mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Design: </h4> ing drugs that can restore a diseased cell to its healthy state is an emerging approach in systems pharmacology to address medical needs that conventional target-based drug discovery paradigms have failed to meet. Single-cell transcriptomics can comprehensively map the differences between diseased and healthy cellular states, making it a valuable technique for systems pharmacology. However, single-cell omics data is noisy, heterogeneous, scarce, and high-dimensional. As a result, no machine learning methods currently exist to use single-cell omics data to design new drug molecules. We have developed a new deep generative framework named MolGene-E to tackle this challenge. MolGene-E combines two novel models: 1) a cross-modal model that can harmonize and denoise chemical-perturbed bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data, and 2) a contrastive learning-based generative model that can generate new molecules based on the transcriptomics data. MolGene-E consistently outperforms baseline methods in generating high-quality, hit-like molecules from gene expression profiles obtained from single-cell datasets as validated by target knock-out experiments using CRISPR. This superior performance is demonstrated across diverse de novo molecule generation metrics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MolGene-E achieves state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot molecular generations. This makes MolGene-E a potentially powerful new tool for drug discovery.",

      "title": "Integrated ambient modeling and genetic demultiplexing of single-cell RNA+ATAC multiome experiments with Ambimux",
      "abstract": "Single cell technologies have advanced at a rapid pace, providing assays for various molecular phenotypes. Droplet-based single cell technologies, particularly those based on nuclei isolation, such as simultaneous RNA+ATAC single-cell multiome, are susceptible to exogenous ambient molecule contamination, which can increase noise in cell type-level associations. We reasoned that genotype-based sample multiplexing can provide an opportunity to infer this ambient contamination by leveraging DNA variation in sequenced reads. Thus, we developed ambimux, a likelihood-based method to estimate ambient fractions and demultiplex single-cell multiome experiments using genotype-level data. Ambimux models the ambient or nuclear probability at the read level and thus can classify empty droplets and estimate droplet-specific ambient molecule fractions in each modality. We first evaluated our method using simulated data sets across a range of parameters. We found that ambimux closely estimated the ground truth droplet contamination fractions in the RNA (MAE=0.048) and ATAC (MAE=0.042) modalities. As a result, ambimux maintained high specificity (>95%) and was able to correctly assign singlets at considerably high ambient fractions (up to 60%) for both RNA and ATAC modalities. In comparison with models that do not consider ambient contamination, these only maintained similar sensitivity levels at considerably lower ambient fractions (up to 25%). We then generated a real data set of seven visceral adipose tissue biopsies run on a single 10x Multiome channel. We ran ambimux and detected 4,986 singlets, capturing similar numbers as other methods. Then, we sought to evaluate the fidelity of the ambient fraction estimates from ambimux. We split singlets into ambient-enriched (>5% contamination in both modalities) or nuclear-enriched (<5% in both) droplets and performed gene-peak linkage analysis. Low ambient droplets resulted in more significant hits with gene-peak links enriched at the transcription start site relative to high ambient droplets, suggesting that the ambient droplets identified by ambimux hamper the identification of biologically meaningful signals. In summary, we developed a joint single-cell multiome demultiplexing method, ambimux, that accurately models and estimates ambient molecule contamination in each modality.",

      "abstract": "Single cell profiling has become a common practice to investigate the complexity of tissues, organs and organisms. Recent technological advances are expanding our capabilities to profile various molecular layers beyond the transcriptome such as, but not limited to, the genome, the epigenome and the proteome. Depending on the experimental procedure, these data can be obtained from separate assays or from the very same cells. Despite development of computational methods for data integration is an active research field, most of the available strategies have been devised for the joint analysis of two modalities and cannot accommodate a high number of them. To solve this problem, we here propose a multiomic data integration framework based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (MOWGAN) suitable for the analysis of paired or unpaired data with high number of modalities (>2). At the core of our strategy is a single network trained on all modalities together, limiting the computational burden when many molecular layers are evaluated.

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  <h4>Motivation</h4>  Single-cell multiomics technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to study cellular heterogeneity. But, integrating information across different omics modalities remains a major challenge due to high dimensionality, sparsity, and modality-specific noise characteristics. To address this, we develop SCREAM (Single-cell Clustering using Representation Autoencoder of Multiomics), a novel deep learning framework for the robust integration and clustering of multi-modal single-cell data. SCREAM leverages Stacked Autoencoders (SAEs) to generate robust latent representations for each omics modality as well as for their fusion. Subsequently, borrowing Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC), SCREAM iteratively fine tunes the integrated mulitomics latent space and single-cell cluster assignments. <h4>Results</h4>  We evaluated SCREAM against eleven state-of-the-art methods using SNARE-seq and CITE-seq datasets. In this benchmarking, SCREAM consistently demonstrated superior performance, yielding the highest or near-highest Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) scores on both datasets. These findings validate SCREAM as a highly accurate and robust approach for identifying cell types from multiomics data. Furthermore, its multiomics embeddings provides biologically meaningful latent representations for diverse downstream analyses. <h4>Availability</h4>  SCREAM is available at http://www.github.com/cabsel/scream . <h4>Contact</h4>  rgunawan@buffalo.edu",

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4> <h4>Background</h4> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the medical field for diverse applications including differential diagnostic support. The estimated training data used to create LLMs such as the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) predominantly consist of English-language texts, but LLMs could be used across the globe to support diagnostics if language barriers could be overcome. Initial pilot studies on the utility of LLMs for differential diagnosis in languages other than English have shown promise, but a large-scale assessment on the relative performance of these models in a variety of European and non-European languages on a comprehensive corpus of challenging rare-disease cases is lacking. <h4>Methods</h4> We created 4967 clinical vignettes using structured data captured with Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Phenopacket Schema. These clinical vignettes span a total of 378 distinct genetic diseases with 2618 associated phenotypic features. We used translations of the Human Phenotype Ontology together with language-specific templates to generate prompts in English, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Turkish. We applied GPT-4o, version gpt-4o-2024-08-06, to the task of delivering a ranked differential diagnosis using a zero-shot prompt. An ontology-based approach with the Mondo disease ontology was used to map synonyms and to map disease subtypes to clinical diagnoses in order to automate evaluation of LLM responses. <h4>Findings</h4> For English, GPT-4o placed the correct diagnosis at the first rank 19·8% and within the top-3 ranks 27·0% of the time. In comparison, for the eight non-English languages tested here the correct diagnosis was placed at rank 1 between 16·9% and 20·5%, within top-3 between 25·3% and 27·7% of cases. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The differential diagnostic performance of GPT-4o across a comprehensive corpus of rare-disease cases was consistent across the nine languages tested. This suggests that LLMs such as GPT-4o may have utility in non-English clinical settings. <h4>Funding</h4> NHGRI 5U24HG011449 and 5RM1HG010860.

Accurate perturbation response models could drastically accelerate drug discovery by reducing the space of interventions that need to be tested in the wet lab. However, recent studies have shown that FM-based models often struggle to outperform simpler baselines for perturbation response prediction. A key obstacle is the lack of understanding of the components driving performance in FM-based perturbation response models. In this work, we conduct the first systematic pan-modal study of perturbation embeddings, with an emphasis on those derived from biological FMs. We benchmark their predictive accuracy, analyze patterns in their predictions, and identify the most successful representation learning strategies.

We introduce CellSpliceNet, an interpretable transformer-based multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict splicing outcomes across the neurons of C. elegans. By integrating four complementary data modalities, namely long-range genomic sequence, local regions of interest (ROIs) in the RNA sequence, secondary structure, and gene expression, CellSpliceNet captures the complex interplay of factors that influence splicing decisions within the cellular context. CellSpliceNet employs modality-specific embeddings including different scales of RNA sequence (exon-flanking and whole-gene), generated RNA structure, and cell-type-specific gene expression. Gene expression and structure encoders employ expressive graph signal processing-based encoders that utilize the graph scattering transform. Further, CellSpliceNet introduces a novel multimodal multi-head attention mechanism that preserves the integrity of each modality while facilitating selective cross-modal interactions, notably allowing cellular gene expression to inform sequence and structural predictions. Attention-based pooling within each modality highlights biologically critical elements, such as canonical intron–exon splice boundaries and accessible single-stranded RNA loop structures within exons. We apply CellSpliceNet to a unique multimodal dataset measuring DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and alternative splicing frequencies in purified neuronal subtypes of the C. elegans.

Yet, while the potential of this technology is vast, the integration of its multifaceted data presents challenges. Some modalities have not reached the robustness or clarity of established scRNA-seq. Coupled with data scarcity for newer modalities and integration intricacies, these challenges limit our ability to maximize single-cell omics benefits. We introduce scCross: a tool adeptly engineered using variational autoencoder, generative adversarial network principles, and the Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN) technique for modality alignment. This synergy ensures seamless integration of varied single-cell multi-omics data. Beyond its foundational prowess in multi-omics data integration, scCross excels in single-cell cross-modal data generation, multi-omics data simulation, and profound in-silico cellular perturbations. Armed with these capabilities, scCross is set to transform the field of single-cell research, establishing itself in the nuanced integration, generation, and simulation of complex multi-omics data.",

      "abstract": "In the era of high-throughput biology, molecular phenotypes have proven effective in predicting disease states and future trajectories. Transcriptomics, in particular, has enabled the dissection of complex diseases with heterogeneous genetic and environmental aetiology, both aiding diagnosis and augmenting treatment. As improving technology has led to measurements of gene expression at increasing granularity, it has become progressively feasible to resolve disease traits that present locally or with spatial heterogeneity. Principal among these are cancers in which tumour gene expression, while itself heterogenous, exhibits a distinct signature from that of the surrounding tissue. Identifying this signature through molecular phenotyping facilitates specific cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, we introduce AGP-Net, a multi-modal foundation framework capable of predicting gene expression from histopathology images. Rather than produce an aggregated estimate of expression for each gene, AGP-Net disaggregates images into spots and attempts to resolve the variation in gene expression across them, thereby providing coarse spatial transcriptomic predictions across the tumour slice and surrounding region. The challenge in doing so is due to data sparsity relative to the dimensionality of the problem: the number of genes and their contextual heterogeneity within and between tissue and cancer types makes it difficult to train a model on the limited data available. The innovation of AGP-Net lies in borrowing strength across similar genes as defined by their textual language descriptions. Our AGP-Net supports datasets with varying gene coverage and facilitates the prediction of gene expression for previously unseen genes based on their textual descriptions. Trained on millions of spots from diverse dataset sources, AGP-Net establishes state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot spatial gene expression prediction, demonstrating its adaptability to generalize across novel scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, imposes a significant societal and economic burden; however, its complex molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study integrates multi-omics data with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to uncover the molecular basis underlying AD phenotype regulation and explore personalized drug repositioning strategies based on individual genetic backgrounds. First, we applied the PrediXcan method to identify candidate genes closely associated with AD cognitive diagnosis, selecting from 61 brain-related traits. We validated these findings through individual-level analysis using gene expression and genotype data from 553 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples in the ROSMAP database. Simultaneously, we constructed a deep, multi-layer information fusion model (AD-MIF) by integrating genotype and gene expression data and employing autoencoders as well as graph autoencoders for multi-modal feature extraction. The results revealed a 10–20% improvement in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for predicting AD-related phenotypes. Both approaches showed high consistency across cellular structures, brain regions, and neurobiological pathways, demonstrating their complementary advantages. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that APOE and its interacting gene APOC1 play a central role in cholesterol metabolism, lipid transport, and immune regulation, while genes such as SCIMP and KAT8 are involved in immune signaling, epigenetic regulation, and neuroprotection. After incorporating attention mechanisms, AD-MIF highlighted the importance of key genes, such as POLR2C and TRAPPC4, in regulating neuronal function. Based on predictive results and enrichment analysis, we further identified candidate drugs, including sirolimus, dasatinib, and MGCD-265. In vivo experiments confirmed that MGCD-265, also known as Glesatinib, and dasatinib significantly improve cognitive deficits in the SAMP8 AD model mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation, pathological tau phosphorylation, and Aβ deposition. This study demonstrates the complementary advantages of bioinformatics pipelines and AI-based multi-modal fusion methods in elucidating the complex pathological mechanisms of AD and enhancing phenotype prediction accuracy. It also provides new theoretical support for personalized drug interventions based on individual genetic characteristics, laying a solid foundation for optimizing early screening, prediction, and personalized treatment strategies. <h4>Graphical Abstract</h4>",

Here, we combine single-cell and spatial multiomics to define 19 distinct tissue niches in the developing heart, leading to the development of a context-aware, resolution-agnostic niche classification tool ( TissueTypist ). Applying high-resolution spatial profiling to the developing sinoatrial node, we resolve three pacemaker cell subtypes arrayed along a linear axis. First trimester subpopulations, such as the pacemaker cells in the sinus horn and sinoatrial node head region, display neuro-attractant programmes and interact with parasympathetic neurons via interactions including Semaphorin-Plexin signalling. Temporal trajectories map maturation of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, uncovering a lipid-metabolic switch and potential key regulators of cell type identity. In the ventricle, we identify cellular and transcriptional gradients along both pseudotime and transmural axes, offering new molecular insights into myocardial compaction and maturation. Comparative profiling of euploid and trisomy 21 hearts shows a depletion of compact cardiomyocytes and heightened apoptosis, validated in isogenic-matched trisomy 21 and euploid iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. This implicates disrupted myocardial growth may be a mechanism for Down’s syndrome-associated congenital heart disease.

The emergence of techniques like CITE-seq has enabled simultaneous quantification of surface protein abundance and transcript expression for multimodal data analysis within individual cells.

However, the small scale of proteins predicted and the poor generalization ability for these computational approaches across diverse contexts, such as different tissues or disease states, impede their widespread adoption. Here we propose SPIDER (surface protein prediction using deep ensembles from single-cell RNA-seq), a context-agnostic zero-shot deep ensemble model, which enables the large-scale prediction of cell surface protein abundance and generalizes better to various contexts. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that SPIDER outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Using the predicted surface abundance of >2500 proteins from single-cell transcriptomes, we demonstrate the broad applications of SPIDER including cell type annotation, biomarker/target identification, and cell-cell interaction analysis in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "Understanding genetic variants effects on the epigenome is crucial for interpreting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results, yet profiling these effects across the non-coding genome remains challenging due to the scalability limits of experimental methods. This necessitates accurate computational models. Existing machine learning approaches, while progressively improving, are confined to the cell types they were trained on, limiting their applicability. Here, we propose the development of a deep learning model, Enformer Celltyping, which can both incorporate distal effects of DNA interactions, up to 100,000 base-pairs away, and predict epigenetic signals in a cell type-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate that Enformer Celltypings predictions of the epigenome out-perform the current best-in-class approach, have strong performance in a range of different cell types and biological regions and generalise to cell types assayed independently of the original training set. Finally, we propose an approach to test epigenetic models performance on genetic variant effect predictions using regulatory quantitative trait loci mapping studies, highlighting Enformer Celltypings and other genomic deep learning models limitations for this task. Our work introduces a new, accurate model for cell type-agnostic histone mark predictions and highlights the benefit of transfer learning for more efficient model development for deep learning in genomics.

Extending these models to single-cell genomics holds significant potential for revealing the cellular and molecular perturbations associated with disease. However, unlike the sequential structure of language, the functional organization of genes is hierarchical and modular. This fundamental difference necessitates the development of meaningful feature selection strategies to adapt NLP transformer architectures effectively. In contrast to many large-scale foundation models, probabilistic models have shown success in learning complex cellular representations from single-cell datasets. In this work, we present TabVI, a probabilistic deep generative model that leverages tabular transformer architectures to improve latent embedding learning. We validate TabVI’s performance in cell type annotation and integration benchmarks. We demonstrate that TabVI improves performance across down-stream tasks and is robust to scaling dataset sizes, producing interpretable, sample-specific feature attention masks.

This narrative review synthesizes recent advances in artificial intelligence as applied to neuromuscular diseases, drawing from peer-reviewed literature from the past five years. Artificial intelligence can augment diagnosis by extracting disease-relevant patterns from imaging, electrophysiology, and multimodal clinical data, improving discrimination between clinically similar entities such as Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Artificial intelligence can also enhance early detection of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Artificial intelligence can utilize digital biomarkers of disease progression data from gait, voice, and wearable sensors for enhanced modeling of disease outcomes. Deep learning–based multi-omics integration, high-throughput phenotypic screening, and artificial intelligence-based protein structure predictive models are accelerating the path from causative mutation, to molecular mechanism, and on to candidate therapy. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain, including data scarcity, heterogeneous acquisition methods, limited external validation, and the need for interpretable models that can win clinician acceptance.

There is, however, a discrepancy between our understanding of this code at the single-cell and population levels: direct measurements indicate the population code is high-dimensional, but established models of single-cell tuning give rise to low-dimensional codes. We reconciled this discrepancy by developing an AI science system to find a new parsimonious, interpretable equation for visual cortical orientation tuning. Candidate equations were expressed as short computer programs and evolved by Large Language Models (LLMs) using graphical diagnostics. The resulting equation not only improved single-cell fits, but also accurately modelled the population code’s high-dimensional geometry. A novel parameter of the AI-discovered equation, which controls single-cell tuning smoothness, gives rise to high-dimensional population codes. The same parameter drives high-dimensional coding in head-direction cells, suggesting a common coding strategy across brain regions. We used this equation to hypothesize a circuit mechanism generating high-dimensional population codes, and to demonstrate the advantages of these codes in a simulated hyperacuity task. These results show that tuning smoothness has a key role in controlling population code geometry, and demonstrate how AI equation discovery can deliver interpretable models accelerating scientific understanding in neuroscience and beyond.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>  Background  Interpreting the pathogenicity of genetic variants remains a critical bottleneck in genomic medicine. Millions of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) hinder the clinical application of genetic findings. Traditional computational approaches often rely on hand-engineered features and fail to capture the complexity of multidimensional genomic annotations fully. Methods  We developed VUS.Life, a multi-modal framework that synergizes semantic text embeddings of biological and clinical annotations with protein language modeling. We transformed variant annotations from Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) into natural language descriptions which are then converted into vector embeddings via established Large Language Models (LLMs), namely all-mpnet-base-v2, MedEmbed-large-v0.1, and text-embedding-004. Pathogenicity of a variant of interest is predicted by its proximity in the vector embedding space with variants of known pathogenicity. We further extended VUS.Life by employing residue-level delta embeddings from the ESMC-600M model to capture both clinical context and biophysical constraints. Results  We evaluated the framework on > 10,000 variants across  <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>  ,  <italic>FBN1</italic>  ,  <italic>ATM</italic>  , and  <italic>PALB2</italic>  genes. VUS.Life achieved greater than 96% accuracy from using VEP annotations alone across all variant types and disease genes evaluated. Additionally, our unsupervised FBN1 structural analysis using ESMC-600M revealed that delta embeddings disentangled distinct pathogenic mechanisms, topologically separating disulfide bond disruptions from calcium-binding defects. These structural clusters correlated strongly with Zero-Shot Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) scores, validating evolutionary fitness as a proxy for pathogenicity. Conclusions  This semantic embedding framework, VUS.Life, accurately captures pathogenicity-relevant features from complex variant annotations, enabling high-accuracy (> 96%) automated classification across multiple genes and models. The approach generalizes beyond well-curated genes and supports scalable, interpretable, and representation-based classification of VUS. It holds significant promise for alleviating the variant interpretation bottleneck in clinical genomics.  </p>",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in measuring high-dimensional modalities, including protein levels and DNA accessibility, at the single-cell level have prompted the need for frameworks capable of handling multi-modal data while simultaneously addressing multiple tasks. Despite these advancements, much of the work in the single-cell domain remains limited, often focusing on either a single-modal or single-task perspective. A few recent studies have ventured into multimodal, multi-task learning, but we identified a ① Optimization Conflict issue, leading to suboptimal results when integrating additional modalities, which is undesirable. Furthermore, there is a ② Costly Interpretability challenge, as current approaches predominantly rely on costly post-hoc methods like SHAP. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce scMoE 1 , a novel framework that, for the first time, applies Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) within the single-cell domain. This is achieved by incorporating an SMoE layer into a transformer block with a cross-attention module. Thanks to its design, scMoE inherently possesses mechanistic interpretability, a critical aspect for understanding underlying mechanisms when handling biological data. Furthermore, from a post-hoc perspective, we enhance interpretability by extending the concept of activation vectors (CAVs). Extensive experiments on simulated datasets, such as Dyngen , and real-world multi-modal single-cell datasets, including { DBiT-seq, Patch-seq, ATAC-seq }, demonstrate the effectiveness of scMoE .

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>  The integration of multi-modal genomic data for cancer classification remains challenging in precision oncology. While machine learning approaches have shown promise, there is a gap between research prototypes and systems with the comprehensive infrastructure required for clinical deployment. <h4>Methods</h4>  I developed Cancer Alpha, an AI system that integrates data from TCGA, GEO, ENCODE, and ICGC ARGO databases for multi-modal cancer classification. The system combines state-of-the-art multi-modal transformer architectures with production infrastructure including containerized deployment, monitoring systems, and security frameworks. I implemented a Multi-Modal Transformer (MMT) architecture incorporating cross-modal attention mechanisms, TabTransformer for structured genomic data, and Perceiver IO for high-dimensional omics integration. <h4>Results</h4>  In synthetic benchmark tests, Cancer Alpha achieved high performance with ensemble models reaching 99% accuracy on optimized datasets. The system includes production infrastructure with Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring capabilities using Prometheus and Grafana. The platform provides a web interface and RESTful API for potential clinical integration. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  Cancer Alpha demonstrates the feasibility of developing production-ready infrastructure for multi-modal cancer classification. The platform’s comprehensive architecture may facilitate future clinical validation and deployment in precision oncology applications, pending validation with real-world clinical data.",

      "abstract": "Alternative splicing profoundly diversifies the transcriptome and proteome, but decoding its regulatory mechanisms remains a challenge. We introduce CellSpliceNet , an interpretable transformer-based multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict splicing outcomes across the neurons of C. elegans . By integrating four complementary data modalities, namely long-range genomic sequence, local regions of interest (ROIs) in the RNA sequence, secondary structure, and gene expression, CellSpliceNet captures the complex interplay of factors that influence splicing decisions within the cellular context. CellSpliceNet employs modality-specific transformer embeddings, incorporating structural representations guided by mutual information and scattering graph embeddings. To this end, a novel and carefully designed multimodal multi-head attention mechanism preserves the integrity of each modality while facilitating selective cross-modal interactions, notably allowing gene expression data to inform sequence and structural predictions. Attention-based pooling within each modality highlights biologically critical elements, such as canonical intron–exon splice boundaries and accessible single-stranded RNA loop structures within the exon. Quantitative comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods demonstrated CellSpliceNet ‘s superior predictive accuracy (Spearman ρ = 0.88) and high accuracy across diverse neuron subtypes. Furthermore, CellSpliceNet elucidates a hierarchical, neuron-specific splicing code by preferentially weighting upstream enhancer motifs (e.g., GGAAGAAC) and identifying neuron-class-specific splicing-factor signatures, including smu-1, unc-75 , and hrp-1 . Thus, CellSpliceNet not only advances the frontiers of alternative splicing predictive capabilities but also provides mechanistic insights into the multimodal regulation of alternative splicing.",

GeneCAD couples representations from a plant DNA foundation model, PlantCAD2, with a lightweight ModernBERT encoder and a chromosome-wide conditional random field that enforces splice-phase and feature order, and applies a protein language-model screen to suppress repeat-driven open reading frames. To limit label noise, we rank and filter public annotations using a sequence-based masked-motif score and fine-tune on five phylogenetically diverse, high-quality references. Across five held out angiosperms, including the allotetraploid  Nicotiana tabacum , GeneCAD improves transcript-level F1 by 8–10% on average over Helixer and BRAKER3, increases exact match transcripts, and sharpens boundaries at start/stop codons and splice junctions. By removing dependence on species-matched RNA-seq or proteomics while retaining cross-species accuracy, GeneCAD provides an accurate, scalable route to biologically coherent plant gene models from DNA alone.",

CITE-seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) is one such multiomics assay, with the ability to connect cell states to functions by simultaneously profiling RNA and surface proteins from the same cell. However, the distinct technical characteristics of these data modalities pose significant challenges to their integration into a cohesive representation of cellular identity. <h4>Results</h4> Here we present multiHIVE, a hierarchical multimodal deep generative model for inferring cellular embeddings by integrating CITE-seq data modalities. multiHIVE employs hierarchically stacked latent variables as well as modality-specific latent variables to capture shared and private information from the modalities respectively, facilitating integration, denoising and imputation tasks. Extensive benchmarking using gold-standard real and simulated datasets demonstrates multiHIVE’s superiority in integrating CITE-seq datasets. Moreover, multiHIVE outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in imputing missing protein measurements and integration of CITE-seq dataset with unimodal dataset. Using a thymocyte development dataset, we showed that multiHIVE’s cellular embeddings can lead to improved trajectory inference and gene trend identification. Finally, using datasets across development and disease, we demonstrated that factorization of multiHIVE-inferred denoised expression into gene expression programs aids in identifying biological processes at multiple levels of cellular hierarchy. <h4>Availability and Implementation</h4> multiHIVE is implemented in Python and is publicly available at https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/multiHIVE .",

      "abstract": "Advanced deep-learning methods, such as foundation models, promise to learn representations of biology that can be employed to predict in silico the outcome of unseen experiments, such as the effect of genetic perturbations on the transcriptomes of human cells. To see whether current models already reach this goal, we benchmarked five foundation models and two other deep learning models against deliberately simplistic linear baselines. For combinatorial perturbations of two genes for which only the individual single perturbations had been seen, we find that the deep learning-based approaches did not perform better than a simple additive model. For perturbations of genes that had not yet been seen, the deep learning-based approaches did not outper-form the baseline of predicting the mean across the training perturbations. We hypothesize that the poor performance is partially because the pre-training data is observational; we show that a simple linear model reliably outperforms all other models when pre-trained on another perturbation dataset. While the promise of deep neural networks for the representation of biological systems and prediction of experimental outcomes is plausible, our work highlights the need for clear setting of objectives and for critical benchmarking to direct research efforts. <h4>Contact</h4> constantin.ahlmann@embl.de",

Recent large language models (LLMs) offer improved accuracy but rely on pre-trained models with limited gene vocabularies and lack of biological contextualization. These constraints make it challenging to effectively fine-tune pre-trained models, especially for novel datasets, non-human species, or disease-specific studies where unique gene expression patterns are critical. To address these constraints, we developed scGenAI, an LLM-based tool that supports straightforward and flexible de novo training, allowing researchers to incorporate genomic and biofunctional contexts to improve accuracy and interpretability on the prediction of cell states. Here, we demonstrate that scGenAI outperforms conventional models in tasks such as cell type prediction and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) malignant cell states identification, making it a powerful tool for single-cell analysis workflows. <h4>Availability and implementation</h4> scGenAI (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14927611 ) is distributed as an open-source Python package, with source code and comprehensive documentation accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/VOR-Quantitative-Biology/scGenAI .",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Single-cell multiomics provides unique insight into the regulatory relationships across different biological layers such as the transcriptome and regulome. However, single-cell multiomics is limited by its ability to capture only static snapshots at the time of observation, restricting the reflection of dynamic state changes orchestrated across modalities. RNA velocity analysis of single cells allows for the prediction of temporal changes in the transcriptome; however, the inferred dynamics cannot be applied across all biological layers, specifically in the regulome. Therefore, to address this limitation, we developed multimodal velocity of single cells (mmVelo), a deep generative model designed to estimate cell state-dependent dynamics across multiple modalities. mmVelo estimates cell state dynamics based on spliced and unspliced mRNA expression, and uses multimodal representation learning to project these dynamics onto chromatin accessibility, inferring chromatin velocity at a single-peak resolution. We applied mmVelo to single-cell multiomics data from a developing mouse brain and validated the accuracy of the estimated chromatin accessibility dynamics. Furthermore, using the estimated dynamics, we identified the transcription factors that are crucial for chromatin accessibility regulation in mouse skin. Finally, using multiomics data as a bridge, we demonstrated that during human brain development, the dynamics of missing modalities can be inferred from single-modal data via cross-modal generation. Overall, mmVelo enhances our understanding of the dynamic interactions between modalities, offering insights into the regulatory relationships across molecular layers.",

We developed an interpretable, multimodal deep learning framework to extract key cellular and molecular signatures from these data. Our graph neural network approach based on spatial proteomic inputs achieved outstanding performance (ROC-AUC > 0.9) in predicting patient treatment response. Key predictive features and associated spatial transcriptomic profiles revealed the multi-omic landscape of immunotherapy response and resistance. One such feature was an interface niche expressing restrictive extracellular matrix factors that physically separates tumor tissue and lymphoid aggregates in nonresponders. We integrate this and other spatially-resolved signatures into SPARC, a multi-omic “fingerprint” comprising scores for immunotherapy response and resistance mechanisms.

Existing models often fail to leverage such feature dependencies during inference, limiting their ability to model complex biological systems. We present a Bayesian group factor analysis transfer learning framework that supports multitask, multi-modal learning. Our approach learns a shared latent space within each domain, simultaneously across multiple domains, and uses a feature-wise prior to model complex relationships. We evaluate our framework using controlled synthetic data experiments and four disjoint patient cancer datasets from acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma. We show that our method improves drug response prediction and more readily recapitulates consensus biomarkers of drug response.

To define the repertoire of actionable T cell targets, we conducted an exhaustive pan-cancer analysis, integrating data from 7,188 RNA-Seq, 1,771 immunopeptidomes from 512 biological samples and 208 single-cell cancer datasets using novel AI methods, and compared these against 17,384 normal samples covering 51 tissues. Our analysis uncovered 62 viable surface protein targets and 28,446 tumor-specific HLA-presented antigens, deriving from 11 distinct molecular events, across 21 tumor types. Among these, we identified 5,928 previously uncharacterized neoantigens, new tumor self-antigens, peptides derived from tumor-specific cryptic ORFs, tumor-associated microbial targets and a novel splicing-derived PMEL peptide (sPMEL) with enhanced abundance and safety compared to the canonical clinical targets. We successfully expanded sPMEL-specific T cells, validating the therapeutic potential of these targets in functional assays. We highlight 153 promising new tumor targets and experimentally validate 19 targets representing six antigen classes. In addition to being the most comprehensive atlas of targets in scope, ImmunoVerse offers the most extensively annotated resource with key parameters for target selection, providing critical insights for therapeutic prioritization and clinical translation.

Utilizing the burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have pioneered the construction of a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, which is based on generative pre-trained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer, effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through the further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications.

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on AoU data demonstrates the model’s predictive value for the onset of various conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom classification tasks, showcasing the architecture’s versatility and efficiency. This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction, proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare.",

      "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show impressive capabilities in image understanding across domains. However, their suitability for high-risk medical diagnostics remains unclear. We systematically evaluate four state-of-the-art LVLMs and three domain-specific models on key cytomorphological benchmarks: peripheral blood cell classification, morphology assessment, bone marrow cell classification, and cervical smear malignancy detection. Performance is assessed under zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned conditions. LVLMs underperform significantly: the best LVLM achieves a zero-shot F1 score of 0.057 ± 0.008 for malignancy detection—near random (0.039)—and only 0.15 ± 0.01 in few-shot. In contrast, domain-specific models reach up to 0.83 in accuracy. Even after fine-tuning, a dedicated hematology model outperforms GPT-4o. While LVLMs offer explainability via text, we find the visual-language grounding unreliable, and the morphological features mention by the model often do not match the single cell properties. Our findings suggest that LVLMs require substantial improvements before use in high-stakes diagnostic settings. <h4>Key findings</h4> LVLMs perform poorly on cytomorphology tasks, often near chance level and far below domain-specific models. Even after fine-tuning, LVLMs lag behind domain-specific models. While LVLMs provide textual justifications, these often reflect generic descriptions rather than image-specific morphological features.",

      "abstract": "<h4>A bstract </h4>  The ever-increasing availability of large-scale single-cell profiles presents an opportunity to develop foundation models to capture cell properties and behavior. However, standard language models such as transformers benefits from sequentially structured data with well defined absolute or relative positional relationships, while single cell RNA data have orderless gene features. Molecular-interaction graphs, such as gene regulatory networks (GRN) or protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, offer graph structure-based models that effectively encode both non-local gene token dependencies, as well as potential causal relationships. We introduce GREmLN ( G ene R egulatory Em bedding-based L arge N eural model), a foundation model that leverages graph signal processing to embed gene token graph structure directly within its attention mechanism, producing biologically informed single cell specific gene embeddings. Our model faithfully captures transcriptomics landscapes and achieves superior performance relative to state-of- the-art baselines on cell type annotation, graph structure understanding, and finetuned reverse perturbation prediction tasks. It offers a unified and interpretable framework for learning high-capacity foundational representations that capture complex, long-range regulatory dependencies from high-dimensional single-cell transcriptomic data. Moreover, the incorporation of graph-structured inductive biases enables more parameter-efficient architectures and accelerates training convergence.",

      "abstract": "While genomic language models are enabling the  de novo design of entire genomes, they remain challenging to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness. Here, we show that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on Nucleotide Transformer activations decompose hidden representations into interpretable biological features without supervision. Across layers and model sizes, SAEs identified over 100 diverse functional annotations encoded in the model’s activations. This included viral regulatory elements such as the CMV enhancer, despite viral genomes being excluded from training data. Tracing this signal revealed contamination in reference databases, demonstrating that interpretability methods can audit training data and identify hidden data leakage. We then show that Meta-SAEs, trained on the decoder weights of another SAE, can identify conceptual hierarchies encoded in the model, including a more abstract feature related to multiple HIV annotations. We confirmed that the features identified by our SAEs were learned during pretraining through probing a randomly initialised model. Finally, we demonstrate that our SAEs allow us to steer model predictions in biologically meaningful ways, showing that we can use an antibiotic-resistance SAE-feature to steer the model toward the A1408G aminoglycoside-resistance mutation in the ribosomal gene 16S rRNA. Together, these results establish SAEs as a method for both discovery and auditing, providing a toolkit for interpretable and trustworthy genomic foundation models.

      "abstract": "Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is critical for advancing our understanding of gene regulation. While single-cell CRISPR perturbation assays such as Perturb-seq provide direct measurements of gene function, the scale of these experiments is limited by cost and feasibility. This motivates the development of computational approaches that can accurately infer responses to unmeasured perturbations from related experimental data. We introduce dbDiffusion, a generative framework that integrates diffusion models with classifier-free guidance derived from perturbation information, operating in latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE). Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that approximate data distributions by reversing a Markovian diffusion process, progressively denoising Gaussian noise into structured outputs. By exploiting biological similarities in gene expression profiles and relationships among perturbations, dbDiffusion enables the conditional generation of gene expressions for previously unobserved perturbations. In contrast to competing approaches, dbDiffusion does not rely on LLM or foundation models, which have been found to yield unsatisfactory results. Rather, it leverages embeddings derived from measured perturbations to generalize to unseen pertur-bations, effectively transferring information across related experimental conditions. In benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods on Perturb-seq datasets, dbDiffusion demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting perturbation responses. A methodological innovation of dbDiffusion is the integration of prediction-powered inference, which corrects for biases inherent in generative models and enables statistically rigorous downstream tasks, including identification of differentially expressed genes. By combining deep generative modeling with principled inference, dbDiffusion establishes a scalable computational framework for predicting and analyzing transcriptomic perturbation responses, significantly extending the utility of Perturb-seq experiments.",

      "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sites on genome, making accurate TF binding site prediction critical for understanding gene regulation and downstream phenotypes. Current deep learning methods use only DNA-related information to predict TF binding sites, ignoring the fact that different TF protein sequences and structures recognize distinct DNA patterns. Not leveraging TF information not only limits prediction accuracy but also makes the methods not generalizable to predicting binding sites of new TFs that do not exist in the traning data. Here, we present TransBind, a protein-aware deep learning architecture that integrates DNA sequence information with protein embeddings containing both sequence and structural information derived from a protein language model pretrained on DNA-binding proteins, to improve TF binding site prediction. Through the cross-attention, a TF embedding selectively attends to genomic regions according to its unique binding properties. Evaluated on the data of 690 ChIP-seq experiments spanning 161 TFs across 91 human cell types, TransBind achieves an AUROC of 0.950 and AUPR of 0.371—representing a ≥11.3% relative AUPR improvement over state-of-the-art methods including TBiNet, DanQ, and DeepSEA. The model outperformed existing methods in ≥97.1% of TF–cell type combinations. It also recovered 160 known TF binding motifs in the JASPAR database, providing the biological interpretability of the model. Moreover, the approach enables zero-shot prediction for unseen TFs, demonstrating its potential of generalizing to new, poorly characterized TFs.

Further, single-cell multi-omics data generated using modern technologies provide several views of omics contribution for the same set of cells. However, dimension reduction and visualization of biological datasets (single or multi-omics) remain a challenging task since obtaining a low-dimensional embedding that preserves information about local and global structures in data, is difficult. Further, combining different views obtained from each omics layer to interpret the underlying biology is even more challenging. Earlier, we have developed NeuroDAVIS which can perform the task of visualization of high-dimensional datasets of a single modality while preserving cluster-structures within the data. Nevertheless, there is no model so far that supports joint visualization of multi-omics datasets. Joint visualization refers to transforming the feature space of each individual modality and combining them to produce a latent embedding that supports visualization of the multi-modal dataset in the newly transformed feature space. In this work, we introduce NeuroMDAVIS which is a generalized version of NeuroDAVIS for visualization of biological datasets having multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, NeuroMDAVIS is the first of its kind multi-modal data visualization model. It is able to learn both local and global relationships in the data while generating a low-dimensional embedding useful for downstream tasks. NeuroMDAVIS competes against state-of-the-art visualization models like t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Fast interpolation-based t-SNE (Fit-SNE), and the Siamese network-based visualization method (IVIS).",

Using the transcriptional phenotypes, we created a minimum distortion embedding map of the pluripotent state, demonstrating rich recapitulation of protein complexes, such as strong co-clustering of MRPL, BAF, SAGA, and Ragulator family members. Additionally, we uncovered transcriptional regulators that are uncoupled from cell fitness, discovering potential novel pluripotency (JOSD1, RNF7) and metabolic factors (ZBTB41). We validated these findings via phenotypic, protein-interaction, and metabolic tracing assays. Finally, we propose a contrastive human-cell engineering framework (CHEF), a machine learning architecture that learns from perturbation cell atlases to predict perturbation recipes that achieve desired transcriptional states. Taken together, our study presents a comprehensive resource for interrogating the regulatory networks governing pluripotency.",

After pre-training with masked nucleotide prediction, CLaP achieved per-token F1 scores exceeding 0.8 for three target ChIP-seq assays in fine-tuning. Attention mechanism analysis revealed that CLaP detects CTCF binding sites with nucleotide-level precision by learning the sequence preference of the CTCF factor and the characteristic ATAC-seq patterns that are caused by protein binding events.

Accurate prediction of antigen–TCR specificity is essential for advancing T cell-based immunotherapies while minimizing autoimmune toxicity. However, current computational methods struggle to generalize across diverse TCR repertoires and reliably differentiate therapeutic antigens from autoimmune-related antigens (arAgs). Here, we introduce TridentTCR, a computational framework integrating a pretrained large language model (LLM) for high-fidelity sequence embedding with a topology-aware graph neural network to capture structural insights from the antigen–TCR interaction network. TridentTCR significantly advances TCR specificity prediction by enabling robust trinary classification, distinguishing TCR interactions involving general antigens, arAgs, and non-binding. Additionally, TridentTCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in binary classification (binding vs. non-binding). Validation on independent clinical datasets demonstrated strong generalization capability for unseen TCRs and antigens. In a disease-specific context, TridentTCR identifies notable cross-reactivity between ZnT8 186-194 -specific TCRs and a mimotope from Bacteroides stercoris , suggesting that T cell cross-reactivity may contribute to the initiation of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, we introduced a quantitative metric, antigenic immune response entropy (AIRE), which leverages TridentTCR predictions alongside clonotype frequencies and repertoire diversity to precisely quantify antigen-specific immune responses from single-cell profiling data.

Flowering plants (angiosperms), the dominant terrestrial clade, exhibit maximal biochemical complexity, extraordinary species diversity (over 100,000 species), relatively recent origins (∼160 million years), ∼200-fold variation in genome size and relative compact coding regions compared with other eukaryotes. These features present both a unique challenge and opportunity for pre-training DNA language models to understand plant-specific evolutionary conservation, regulatory architectures and genomic functions. Here, we introduce PlantCAD2, a long-context, plant-specific DNA language model with single-nucleotide resolution, pre-trained on 65 angiosperm genomes, together with a series of public benchmarks for evaluation. Comprehensive zero-shot testing shows that PlantCAD2 (676 million parameters) efficiently captures evolutionary conservation, surpassing the 7-billion-parameter Evo2 model in 10 of 12 tasks. With parameter-efficient fine-tuning, PlantCAD2 also outperforms the 1-billion-parameter AgroNT across seven cross-species tasks including chromatin accessible region, gene expression and protein translation. Moreover, its 8,192bp context window substantially improves accessible chromatin prediction in large genomes such as maize (AUPRC increasing from 0.587 to 0.711), underscoring the importance of long-range context for modeling distal regulation. Together, these results establish PlantCAD2 as a powerful, efficient, and versatile foundation model for plant genomics, enabling accurate genome annotation across diverse species.",

      "abstract": "Massively generated single-cell multi-omics datasets are revolutionizing biological studies of heterogenous tissues and organisms, which necessitate powerful computational methods to unleash the full potential of these tremendous data. Here, we present Concerto, stands for self-distillation contrastive learning of cell representations, a self-supervised representation learning framework optimized with asymmetric teacher-student configuration to analyze single-cell multi-omics datasets with scalability up to building 10 million-cell reference within 1.5 hour and querying 10k cells within 8 seconds. Concerto leverages dropout layer as minimal data augmentation to learn meaningful cell representations in a contrastive manner. The teacher module uses attention mechanism to aggregate contextualized gene embeddings within cellular context, while the student module uses simpler dense structure with discreate input. The learned task-agnostic representations can be adapted to a broad range of single-cell computation tasks. 1) Via supervised fine-tuning, Concerto enables automatic cell classification as well as novel cell-type discovery; 2) Attention weights provide model interpretability via automatically extracting specific molecular signatures at single-cell resolution without the needs of clustering; 3) Via source-aware training, Concerto supports efficient data integration by projecting all cells across multiple batches into a joint embedding space. 4) Via batch-aware inference or unsupervised fine-tuning, Concerto enables mapping query cells onto reference and accurately transferring annotations. Concerto can flexibly extend to multi-omics datasets simply through cross-modality summation operation to obtain unified cell embeddings. Using examples from human peripheral blood, human thymus, human pancreas, and mouse tissue atlas, Concerto shows superior performance benchmarking against other top-performing methods. We also demonstrate Concerto recapitulates detailed COVID-19 disease variation through query-to-reference mapping. Concerto can operate on all genes and represents a fully data-driven approach with minimum prior distribution assumptions, eliminating the needs of PCA-like or autoencoder-like dimensionality reduction, which significantly reforms the current best practice. Concerto is a simple, straightforward, robust, and scalable framework, offering a brand new perspective to derive cell representations and can effectively satisfy the emerging paradigm of query-to-reference mapping in the era of atlas-level single-cell multimodal analysis.",

      "abstract": "The identification of non-coding somatic cancer-driver mutations remains challenging due to difficulties in interpreting rare and ultra-rare variants. We hypothesized that sequence-based models can be used to systematically prioritize such mutations for their functional relevance. Here we present a computational framework that leverages sequence-based models to assess the functional impact of (ultra-)rare somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in promoter regions. We analysed SNVs derived from 24,529 whole-tumour genomes from three cohorts and applied the sequence-based model PARM, which was trained on massively parallel reporter assay data. We identified up to 492 promoter regions significantly enriched for putatively functional SNVs, including known cancer-drivers such as TERT . Overall, we find that functional promoter mutations are significantly enriched in established cancer-driver genes ( p -value = 9.7·10 -5 ). Cross-cohort validation and replication using an independent sequence-based model (Borzoi) identified nine candidate cancer genes where the prioritized promoter mutations were shown to be functional by affecting gene expression levels. These genes included well known cancer genes such as including TERT, TP53 and PMS2 , but also several new candidates for which no coding mutations have previously been implicated in cancer, including PMS2, AIMP2, SASS6, RPL13A, ALKBH4, FICD and YAE1 . These findings demonstrate the utility of sequence-based models for identifying functional non-coding mutations and provide a framework for uncovering regulatory elements implicated in cancer.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global health, economics, and daily life, with over 776 million cases and 7 million deaths from December 2019 to November 2024. Since the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain emerged, the virus has evolved into variants such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, all characterized by mutations in the Spike glycoprotein, critical for viral entry into human cells via its S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit, binding to the ACE2 receptor and mutating frequently, affects infectivity and immune evasion; the more conserved S2, on the other hand, facilitates membrane fusion. Predicting future mutations is crucial for developing vaccines and treatments adaptable to emerging strains, enhancing preparedness and intervention design. Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly common in the field of genomics, given their ability to generate realistic synthetic biological sequences, including applications in protein design and engineering. Here we present SARITA, an LLM with up to 1.2 billion parameters, based on GPT-3 architecture, designed to generate high-quality synthetic SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 sequences. SARITA is trained via continuous learning on the pre-existing protein model RITA. When trained on Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants (data up to February 2021 included), SARITA correctly predicts the evolution of future S1 mutations, including characterized mutations of Delta, Omicron and Iota variants. Furthermore, we show how SARITA outperforms alternative approaches, including other LLMs, in terms of sequence quality, realism, and similarity with real-world S1 sequences. These results indicate the potential of SARITA to predict future SARS-CoV-2 S1 evolution, potentially aiding in the development of adaptable vaccines and treatments.",

Mapping their genome-wide binding and co-binding landscape is essential towards a mechanistic understanding of their functions in gene regulation and resulting cellular phenotypes. However, due to the lack of techniques that effectively scale across proteins and biological samples, their genome-wide binding profiles remain challenging to obtain, particularly in primary cells. Here we present Chromnitron, a multimodal foundation model that accurately predicts CAP binding landscapes across hundreds of proteins in unseen cell types. Via in silico perturbation experiments, we show that the model learned principles of CAP binding from multimodal features including DNA sequence motifs, chromatin accessibility levels, and protein functional domains. Applying Chromnitron to study cell fate transitions, we discovered novel CAPs regulating the T cell exhaustion process. Furthermore, Chromnitron can predict the dynamic CAP binding landscapes during development, revealing the global orchestration of protein and regulatory element activities in neurogenesis. We expect Chromnitron to accelerate discovery and engineering in regulatory genomics, particularly in human primary cells, and empower future therapeutic opportunities.",

      "title": "Optimised dissociation and multimodal profiling of prostate cancer stroma reveal fibromuscular cell heterogeneity with clinical correlates",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Dynamic remodelling of the tumour microenvironment (TME) plays a central role in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, immune evasion and therapy resistance. However, the co-existence of both tumour-promoting and tumour-restraining stromal elements necessitates extensive characterisation of the TME for effective targeting. Fibromuscular cell heterogeneity in PCa remains poorly characterised, in part due to challenges in isolating cells embedded within the desmoplastic stroma. This study therefore aimed to better characterise fibroblast and smooth muscle cell (SMC) populations as the major tissue-resident stromal cell subtypes within the PCa TME. <h4>Methods</h4> A PCa single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset was re-analysed to define fibromuscular subtypes. Due to low fibroblast yields, an optimised tissue dissociation protocol was developed and benchmarked against two commercial kits via flow cytometry, immunostaining of clinical specimens and ex vivo culture. Dimensionality reduction and clustering were applied to the CD31 − stromal fraction using a multiparameter surface marker panel. Annotation of the resulting clusters based on their surface marker profile was supported by integrating scRNA-seq and immuno-histological findings. <h4>Results</h4> The optimised protocol yielded over twice the viable cells/mg tissue compared to two commercial kits, preserved surface marker integrity, enhanced successful cultivation of mesenchymal cells and recovered diverse stromal subpopulations from benign and malignant samples. Dimensionality reduction and clustering of flow cytometry counts identified 11 distinct CD31 − stromal populations. Integration with transcriptomic data and immunofluorescence of clinical specimens identified spatially- and prognostically-distinct fibroblast subtypes, including inflammatory and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, pericytes linked to poor prognosis and a novel SMC subset associated with stromal activation. <h4>Conclusion</h4> This study presents a robust workflow for improved isolation and characterisation of fibromuscular stromal cells in PCa. The multimodal approach enabled refined characterisation of phenotypically distinct and clinically-relevant stromal subpopulations within their spatial context providing a foundation for future TME-targeted therapies.",

Inspired by this, we present MassNet, a foundational resource for proteomics designed to accelerate deep learning applications. MassNet is the largest known corpus of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry (MS) data, derived from ~30 TB of raw files and comprising 1.54 billion MS/MS spectra, resulting in 558 million peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) across 35 species, including animals, plants, and microbes. Within the human subset, MassNet includes more than 1.7 million precursors and 19,966 proteins, covering 98% of annotated human proteins. To enable efficient AI training, we developed the Mass Spectrometry Data Tensor (MSDT), a structured format based on Parquet that enables standardized, high-performance batch access and seamless integration with GPU and TPU platforms for distributed training. We further extended MassNet to support de novo peptide sequencing, which infers peptide sequences directly from MS/MS spectra without reference databases, and is critical for discovering novel proteins, characterizing non-model organisms, and identifying post-translational modifications (PTMs). We introduce XuanjiNovo, a non-autoregressive Transformer model that leverages a curriculum learning strategy to enhance training stability. By dynamically adjusting learning difficulty based on model performance, XuanjiNovo achieves smooth convergence on complex, multi-distributional data without manual hyperparameter tuning. Trained on 100 million PSMs from the MassNet, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarking tasks. Peptide recall exceeds 0.8 on the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Zea mays datasets. On human data acquired using the Orbitrap Astral platform, XuanjiNovo achieves achieves 38.8% to 144.3% improvement over existing models. MassNet represents the first large-scale, standardized foundational dataset in proteomics, marking a critical milestone in the integration of artificial intelligence into proteomics research.",

      "title": "A developmental cell atlas of the human thyroid gland",
      "abstract": "The primary function of the thyroid gland is the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones, which are essential for health from embryogenesis to adulthood. Thyroid disorders occur frequently and include congenital hypothyroidism, which occurs due to aberrant thyroid development (thyroid dysgenesis) or impaired hormone synthesis and is particularly prevalent in trisomy 21 (T21). In contrast, thyroid carcinoma, an acquired disorder, is the most common endocrine malignancy in both paediatric and adult populations. Understanding the molecular basis of thyroid dysgenesis and paediatric thyroid carcinoma remains challenging, and requires an improved understanding of foetal thyroid development. To address this, we generated a comprehensive spatiotemporal atlas of the human thyroid during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Profiling over 200,000 cells with single-cell sequencing revealed key cell types involved in thyroid gland development, including the hormone-producing thyrocytes. We discovered that foetal thyroid follicular cells are heterogeneous epithelial populations consisting of two main functional subtypes (fTFC1, fTFC2), with fTFC2 expressing increased levels of PAX8, and spatial transcriptomics revealed subtype co-occurrence within individual follicles. While both fTFC1 and fTFC2 persist in adult thyroid, fTFC2 is a minor population amongst additional PAX8-positive follicular cell subsets. We observed thyroid dysgenesis in T21 age-matched specimens, and T21 thyrocytes showed transcriptional signatures of cytoskeletal disorganisation and altered interactions with the extracellular matrix, as well as compensatory activation of metabolic stress gene programs and upregulation of thyroid biosynthetic genes. In line with the altered proportions of fTFC2 in healthy foetal and adult thyroid, papillary thyroid cancer in children is transcriptionally enriched for the fTFC2 signature compared to that in adults. All together, these findings reveal thyrocyte heterogeneity across the lifespan and provide insights into thyroid development in health and disease, informing potential therapeutic interventions.",

Here we dissect it by perturbing colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids longitudinally with drugs in sequence. Combining longitudinal tracking, single cell ’omics, evolutionary modelling, and machine leaning, we found that different targeted drugs select for distinct subclones, supporting rationally designed drug sequences. The cellular memory was encoded as a heritable epigenetic configuration, from which multiple transcriptional programmes could run, supporting a one-to-many (epi)genotype-to- phenotype map that explains how clonal expansions and plasticity manifest together. This may ensure drug resistance subclones can exhibit distinct phenotypes in changing environments while still preserving the cellular memory encoding for their selective advantage. Chemotherapies resistance was instead entirely driven by plasticity. Inducing further chromosomal instability before drug application changed clonal evolution but not convergent transcriptional programmes. Collectively, our data show how genetic and epigenetic alterations are selected to “permissive epigenome” enabling phenotypic plasticity.",

Despite their crucial regulatory roles, microRNAs (miRNAs) face a significant curation bottleneck, with only 1,400 articles manually curated to the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase over a decade. We present GOFlowLLM, an automated curation pipeline powered by reasoning-enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) that follows established GO curation flowcharts to extract and structure miRNA-mediated gene silencing data at scale. When evaluated on existing curation, GOFlowLLM selects the correct GO term in 90% of cases. Curators also agree with 95% of the system’s reasoning steps and 90% of the evidence selected. Applied to 6,996 previously uncurated articles, our system identified 2,538 new candidate GO annotations on 1,785 articles in just 58 hours—potentially doubling the available miRNA GO curation. Manual review of a subset of these annotations shows that curators agreed with the selected term in 87% of cases, the model’s reasoning in 92% of cases, and the extracted evidence in 93%. GOFlowLLM demonstrates how LLMs can significantly accelerate biocuration while maintaining high-quality standards by following expert-designed reasoning frameworks. The integration of reasoning traces in our system provides transparent justification for annotations that can be reviewed by human curators, addressing one of the key challenges in adopting AI for scientific curation, potentially transforming how we manage the growing corpus of scientific knowledge in molecular biology.

To understand viral pathogenesis, methods are available for studying dissociated cells in blood, nasal samples, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and similar, but a robust platform for deep tissue characterisation of molecular and cellular responses to virus infection in the lungs is still lacking. We developed an innovative spatial multi-omics platform to investigate COVID-19-infected lung tissues. Five tissue-profiling technologies were combined by a novel computational mapping methodology to comprehensively characterise and compare the transcriptome and targeted proteome of virus infected and uninfected tissues. By integrating spatial transcriptomics data (Visium, GeoMx and RNAScope) and proteomics data (CODEX and PhenoImager HT) at different cellular resolutions across lung tissues, we found strong evidence for macrophage infiltration and defined the broader microenvironment surrounding these cells. By comparing infected and uninfected samples, we found an increase in cytokine signalling and interferon responses at different sites in the lung and showed spatial heterogeneity in the expression level of these pathways. These data demonstrate that integrative spatial multi-omics platforms can be broadly applied to gain a deeper understanding of viral effects on cellular environments at the site of infection and to increase our understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the lungs.",

      "abstract": "With the development of single-cell technology, many cell traits (e.g. gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation) can be measured. Furthermore, the multi-omic profiling technology could jointly measure two or more traits in a single cell simultaneously. In order to process the various data accumulated rapidly, computational methods for multimodal data integration are needed. Previously, we developed inClust, a flexible all-in deep generative framework for transcriptome data. Here, we extend the applicability of inClust into the realm of multimodal data by adding two mask modules: an input-mask module in front of the encoder and an output-mask module behind the decoder. We call this augmented model inClust+, and apply it to various multimodal data. InClust+ was first used to integrate scRNA and MERFISH data from similar cell populations and to impute MERFISH data based on scRNA data. Then, inClust+ is shown to have the capability to integrate a multimodal data contain scRNA and scATAC or two multimodal CITE datasets with batch effect. Finally, inClust+ is used to integrate a monomodal scRNA dataset and two multimodal CITE datasets, and generate the missing modality of surface protein in monomodal scRNA data. In the above examples, the performance of inClust+ is better than or comparable to the most recent tools to the corresponding task, which prove inClust+ is a suitable framework for handling multimodal data. Meanwhile, the successful implementation of mask in inClust+ means that it can be applied to other deep learning methods with similar encoder-decoder architecture to broaden the application scope of these models.",

      "abstract": "Single-cell gene expression is influenced by diverse covariates such as genomics protocol, tissue origin, donor attributes, and microenvironment, which are challenging to disentangle. We present CellDISECT, a novel method combining disentangled representations and causal inference for multi-batch, multi-covariate single-cell data analysis. CellDISECT employs a mixture of expert variational autoencoders to learn covariate-specific and unsupervised latent spaces, enabling counterfactual predictions and biological discovery. Drawing inspiration from LLM training on synthetic data, CellDISECT generates synthetic counterfactuals during training and their quality is scored in the loss function. This semi-autoencoding of counterfactuals during training increases model performance in counterfactual predictions at test time. Benchmarking across datasets, CellDISECT outperformed existing methods in disentanglement, counterfactual in-silico prediction of responses to perturbations, and cell type discovery. CellDISECT predicted responses of cells to changing tissue microenvironments and identified a novel pre-natal megakaryocyte subpopulation with immune characteristics distinct from classical platelet-producing MKs, highlighting its unique capabilities in single-cell analysis to help identify novel subpopulations and reduce concerns of technical effects during integration.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>  Generative AI is increasingly used to extract structured information across domains, but its reliability in academic and clinical research, where precision and accuracy are essential, remains largely unexplored. This study evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs)-based algorithms to generate accurate, literature-based summaries of human genomic variants, with a focus on real-world usability. <h4>Results</h4>  We benchmarked five open-access generative AI platforms—ChatGPT, MistralAI, VarChat, Perplexity, and ScholarAI—across 40 curated variants equally divided between somatic and germline settings. For each variant, summary reports were generated and blindly evaluated by domain experts using five defined metrics. VarChat emerged as the top-ranked tool, showing the highest summarization accuracy, citation relevance, and robustness against hallucinations. Gpt-4o consistently ranked second, showing particularly stable robustness in conditions where the literature was scarce. Perplexity and ScholarAI, despite being literature-focused, ranked lowest across most metrics. Tool performance was strongly influenced by the availability of peer-reviewed literature, confirming that current generative models remain sensitive to data scarcity. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of current generative AI tools in genomic variant interpretation workflows. While some platforms already provide useful outputs, reliable integration into basic and clinical research requires expert validation and domain-related fine-tuning. This work provides for the first time a curated benchmark for assessing LLM-generated content in variant genomics and underscores the need for caution when using these tools to support variant interpretation.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in cohort-level proteomic profiling have offered unprecedented opportunities for discovering novel biomarkers and developing diagnostic and predictive tools for complex human diseases. However, the inherent complexity of proteomics data and the scarcity of phenotypic labels, particularly for rare diseases, pose significant challenges in modeling proteome-phenome relationships. Utilizing proteomics data from 2,924 plasma proteins measured in 53,014 UK Biobank participants, we introduce Prophet, an interpretable deep learning framework that combines transformer architecture with a multistage, multitask training strategy to improve disease prediction and biological discovery from personal proteomic profiles. Prophet begins with self-supervised pretraining to model protein interactions, followed by prompt-based fine-tuning for disease diagnosis, and concludes with continuous fine-tuning for disease prediction. Extensive benchmarking across more than 100 diseases demonstrates Prophet’s superior performance over multiple baseline methods, achieving the highest increase in the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 132.71% for disease diagnosis and 60.29% for disease prediction. Specifically, Prophet enhances diagnostic accuracy for 95.83% of diseases and boosts predictive accuracy for 94.02% of diseases. Through model interpretation, Prophet identifies 21,549 and 25,915 protein-disease associations for prevalent and incident diseases, respectively, and uncovers prevailing proteomics-based similarities among diseases.

      "abstract": "In bioinformatics research, traditional machine learning methods have demonstrated efficacy in addressing Euclidean data. However, real-world data often encompasses non-Euclidean forms, such as graph data, which contain intricate structural patterns or high-order relationships that elude conventional machine-learning approaches. Representation learning seeks to derive valuable data representations from enhancing predictive or analytic tasks, capturing vital patterns and structures. This method has proven particularly beneficial in bioinformatics and biomedicine, as it effectively handles high-dimensional, sparse data, detects complex biological patterns, and optimizes predictive performance. In recent years, graph representation learning has become a popular research direction. It embeds graphs into a low-dimensional space while preserving the structural and attribute information of the graph, enabling better feature extraction for downstream tasks. This study extensively reviews representation learning advancements, particularly in the research of representation methods since the emergence of COVID-19. We begin with an analysis and classification of neural network-based language model representation learning techniques as well as graph representation learning methods. Subsequently, we explore their methodological innovations in the context of COVID-19, with a focus on the domains of drugs, public health, and healthcare. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with graph representation learning. This comprehensive review presents invaluable insights for researchers as it documents the development of COVID-19 and offers experiential lessons to preempt future infectious diseases.

      "abstract": "Accurate decision making in precision oncology depends on integration of multimodal molecular information, such as the genetic data, gene expression, protein abundance, and epigenetic measurements. Deep learning methods facilitate integration of heterogeneous datasets. However, almost all published deep learning-based bulk multi-omics integration methods have constrained usability. They suffer from lack of transparency, modularity, deployability, and are applicable exclusively to narrow tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Flexynesis, a versatile tool designed with usability, and adaptability in mind. Flexynesis streamlines data processing, enforces structured data splitting, and ensures rigorous model evaluation. It offers unsupervised feature selection, different omics layer fusion options, and hyperparameter tuning. Users can choose from distinct architectures: fully connected networks, variational autoencoders, multi-triplet networks, graph neural networks, and cross-modality encoding networks. Each model is complemented with a straightforward input interface and standardized training, evaluation, and feature importance quantification methods, enabling easy incorporation into data integration pipelines. For improved user experience, Flexynesis supports features such as on-the-fly task determination and compatibility with regression, classification, and survival modeling. It accommodates multi-task prediction of a mixture of numerical/categorical outcome variables with a tolerance for missing labels. We also developed an extensive benchmarking pipeline, showcasing the tool's capability across diverse real-life datasets. This toolset should make deep-learning based bulk multi-omics data integration in the context of clinical/pre-clinical data analysis and marker discovery more accessible to a wider audience with or without experience in deep-learning development.

      "abstract": "RNA sequences exhibit lower evolutionary conservation than proteins due to their informationally constrained four-letter alphabet, compared to the 20-letter code of proteins. More limited information makes unsupervised learning of structural and functional evolutionary patterns more challenging from single RNA sequences. We overcame this limitation by mapping RNA sequences to pseudo-protein sequences to allow effective transfer training from a protein language model (protein Evolution-Scale Model 2, protESM-2). The resulting RNA ESM (RESM) outperforms 12 existing RNA language models in zero-shot prediction, not only in sequence classification but also in RNA secondary structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction. Further supervised fine-tuning demonstrates RESM’s generalizability and superior performance over the existing models compared across multiple downstream tasks, including mRNA ribosome loading efficiency and gene expression prediction, despite RESM being trained exclusively on noncoding RNAs. Moreover, RESM can generalize to unseen sequences beyond its 1,024-nucleotide training limit, achieving 81.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods in supervised secondary structure prediction for RNAs up to 4,000 nucleotides, limited only by the available GPU memory, while providing >1000-fold speedup compared to MSA-based approaches.

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4>  Characterizing the distribution of biological marker expression at the single cell level in whole tissues requires diverse image analysis steps, such as segmentation of cells and nuclei, detection of RNA transcripts (or other staining), or their integration (e.g., assigning nuclei and RNA dots to their corresponding cell). Several software programs or algorithms have been developed for each step independently, but integrating them into a comprehensive pipeline for the quantification of individual cells from 3D imaging samples remains a significant challenge. We developed FishFeats, an open-source and flexible Napari (Sofroniew et al . 2025) plugin, to perform all of these steps together within the same framework, taking advantage of available and efficient software applications. The primary core of our pipeline is to propose a user-friendly tool for users who do not have a computational background. FishFeats streamlines extracting quantitative information from multimodal 3D fluorescent microscopy images (smFISH expression in individual cells, immunohistochemical staining, cell morphologies, cell classification) to a unified “cell-by-cell” table for downstream analysis, without requiring any coding. Our second focus is to propose and ease manual correction of each step, as measurement accuracy can be very sensitive to small errors in the automatic process. <h4>Availability and implementation</h4>  FishFeats is open source under the BSD-3 license, freely available on github: https://github.com/gletort/FishFeats .

Applied to modified peptides, Prosit-PTM enhances PTM-site localization in phosphoproteomics, increases identification of multiply modified peptides in histones, and enables data-driven rescoring for unseen modifications such as HLA peptides. Furthermore, the learned embeddings of amino acids and modifications capture physicochemical relationships underlying PTM-driven HLA presentation.

      "abstract": "Understanding how regulatory complexity and constraint shape organismal development remains a central challenge in biology. The developmental hourglass framework posits that mid-embryogenesis –the phylotypic stage– is a period of heightened conservation and regulatory organization. We test this using Zebraformer, a transformer-based language model trained on single-cell transcriptomic data from zebrafish embryos. Unlike models focused on prediction or classification, Zebraformer learns context-sensitive representations of genes and cells that encode temporal progression, anatomical identity, and regulatory relationships. Embeddings reflect differentiation timing and transcriptional divergence, while attention-derived gene networks reveal a transient rise in complexity during the phylotypic stage. This stage also exhibits increased perturbation sensitivity and a shift toward centralized, modular network topology. These features are supported by graph-theoretic metrics and gene ontology enrichment, offering data-driven evidence for highly structured regulation during mid-embryogenesis. Our results demonstrate that language models can extract interpretable biological structure and support longstanding developmental theory from high-dimensional data. <h4>Significance statement</h4>  Understanding how cells coordinate to build a complex organism remains a central challenge in biology. Development is not only genetically encoded but context-dependent; shaped by dynamic interactions among genes, cells, and time. Here, we use a transformer-based language model, Zebraformer, trained on single-cell gene expression data from zebrafish embryos, to investigate how regulatory structure evolves during development. The model captures key features of organismal formation: increasing transcriptional divergence, anatomical specificity, and a transient rise in regulatory complexity and perturbation sensitivity during the conserved phylotypic stage. These findings provide data-driven support for the developmental hourglass hypothesis and demonstrate that contextual models can uncover fundamental organizational principles from biological data alone.",

However, most direct applications of DL will deliver models with limited transparency and explainability, which constrain their deployment in biomedical settings. <h4>Methods: </h4> This systematic review discusses DL models used to support inference in cancer biology with a particular emphasis on multi-omics analysis. It focuses on how existing models address the need for better dialogue with prior knowledge, biological plausibility and interpretability, fundamental properties in the biomedical domain. For this, we retrieved and analyzed 42 studies focusing on emerging architectural and methodological advances, the encoding of biological domain knowledge and the integration of explainability methods. <h4>Results: </h4> We discuss the recent evolutionary arch of DL models in the direction of integrating prior biological relational and network knowledge to support better generalisation (e.g. pathways or Protein-Protein-Interaction networks) and interpretability. This represents a fundamental functional shift towards models which can integrate mechanistic and statistical inference aspects. We introduce a concept of bio-centric interpretability and according to its taxonomy, we discuss representational methodologies for the integration of domain prior knowledge in such models. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> The paper provides a critical outlook into contemporary methods for explainability and interpretabiltiy used in DL for cancer. The analysis points in the direction of a convergence between encoding prior knowledge and improved interpretability. We introduce bio-centric interpretability which is an important step towards formalisation of biological interpretability of DL models and developing methods that are less problem- or application-specific.",

We interrogated the cellular and transcriptional landscapes of 60 MCC-patients using a combination of multiplex proteomics, in-situ RNA-hybridization, and spatially oriented transcriptomics.

This spatial immune response pattern was conserved in another virus-positive tumor, HPV + head-and-neck cancer.

      "abstract": "Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to histopathology are now common, but most require supervision which inherently limits their scope. By using self-supervised learning (SSL), we discover and quantify the full range of histopathological appearances in a disease, and associate them with clinicopathological ground truths such as prognosis. We used this approach to discover under-appreciated morphologies of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), using a highly characterised resected tumour cohort of over 4000 slides from over 1000 patients. By constructing an authoritative lexicon of recurrent LUAD appearances, we ab initio discovered several stromal morphologies strongly predictive of outcome. With multimodal data integration and external dataset validation, we propose that epithelial discohesion is lethal, but only in the context of immunologically cold stroma. Both these morphological features are independent of current prognostic schema. Crucially, we describe these features in the context of real-world diagnostic histopathology, giving them immediate clinical translatability.",

The H&E image and spatial transcriptomic data indicate abundant features which are different and complementary to each other. AI algorithms can perform nonlinear analysis on these aligned or unaligned complex datasets to decode tumoral heterogeneity for detecting functional domain. However,the interpretability of AI-generated outcomes for human experts is a problem hindering application of multi-modal analysis in clinic. We presented a machine learning based toolchain called StereoMM, which is a graph fusion model that can integrate gene expression, histological images, and spatial location. StereoMM firstly performs information interaction on transcriptomic and imaging features through the attention module, guaranteeing explanations for its decision-making processes. The interactive features are input into the graph autoencoder together with the graph of spatial position, so that multimodal features are fused in a self-supervised manner. Here, StereoMM was subjected to mouse brain tissue, demonstrating its capability to discern fine tissue architecture, while highlighting its advantage in computational speed. Utilizing data from Stereo-seq of human lung adenosquamous carcinoma and 10X Visium of human breast cancer, we showed its superior performance in spatial domain recognition over competing software and its ability to reveal tumor heterogeneity. The fusion approach for imaging and gene expression data within StereoMM aids in the more accurate identification of domains, unveils critical molecular features, and elucidates the connections between different domains, thereby laying the groundwork for downstream analysis.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4> Despite the improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), a significant proportion of those patients still face challenges with refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease after receiving first-line R-CHOP treatment. Characterizing the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is crucial for understanding relapsed/refractory disease. However, the complex and diverse nature of the TME has impeded progress. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq), we explored the DLBCL landscape at single-cell resolution, profiling 77,344 cells from both primary and relapsed DLBCL patients. We further investigated the shared and distinct molecular and cellular features of tumor microenvironment in both primary and relapsed DLBCL tumors by integrating next-generation DNA sequencing data and multiple scRNA-seq datasets from total 72,351 cells. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant decrease of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells, along with excessive activation of the TNF-NFκB signaling pathways in malignant B cells in R/R disease. Furthermore, by using multiplex IHC, we confirmed that CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells are prognostic and predictive biomarkers for response to R-CHOP treatment. As a proof of concept, we successfully generated mutilplexed images of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells from a single DAPI staining in human DLBCL tissues through using generative artificial intelligence. Our study offers critical insights into the heterogeneity and molecular features of DLBCL, shedding light on the crucial role of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells in the recurrent process. <h4>Highlights</h4> Shared and distinct molecular and cellular features of tumor microenvironment in both primary and relapsed DLBCL tumors; The characteristic of relapsed DLBCL TME is a dysfunctional immune microenvironment with a significant decrease of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells.

We show that this approach leads to an improvement in predictive performance and a reduction in training time for a broad range of prediction tasks relevant to understanding metabolite functions in living systems, using a range of datasets derived from MoleculeNet. We see the biggest improvement for regression tasks, e.g. prediction of lipophilicity and aqueous solubility of molecules, and a robust improvement for most classification tasks.

      "abstract": "<h4>SUMMARY</h4>  mRNAs associate with single or multiple ribosomes; these ribosomal assemblies — monosomes and polysomes — translate the mRNAs before degradation. The impact of heat stress on this mRNA turnover remains unclear. In heat-shocked yeast cells, the proportion of monosomes within the ribosomal assemblies rises without a corresponding increase in the number of mRNAs associated with them. As a result, most monosomes are devoid of mRNAs and silent, lacking translational initiation factors and proteins facilitating posttranslational folding. The accumulation of silent ribosomes generally reduces the rate of association of transcripts with the ribosomes. However, elevated temperatures enhance the ribosomal association of specific mRNAs, primarily those encoding heat-shock proteins, allowing them to balance their increased degradation rates. Additionally, reduced binding of the Xrn1 exonuclease to mRNAs diminishes the influence of codon optimality on mRNA stability. These mechanisms reorganize mRNA turnover to prioritize heat-shock protein synthesis over ribosome biogenesis.",

      "abstract": "<h4>  A  bstract </h4>  Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet current single-cell foundation models (scFMs) remain limited in their scalability, flexibility across diverse tasks, and ability to natively integrate textual information. In this work, we build upon the Cell2Sentence (C2S) framework, which represents scRNA-seq profiles as textual “cell sentences,” to train Large Language Models (LLMs) on a corpus comprising over one billion tokens of transcriptomic data, biological text, and metadata. Scaling the model to 27 billion parameters yields consistent improvements in predictive and generative capabilities and supports advanced downstream tasks that require synthesis of information across multi-cellular contexts. Targeted fine-tuning with modern reinforcement learning techniques produces strong performance in perturbation response prediction, natural language interpretation, and complex biological reasoning. This predictive strength enabled a dual-context virtual screen that nominated the kinase inhibitor silmitasertib (CX-4945) as a candidate for context-selective upregulation of antigen presentation. Experimental assessment in human cell models unseen during training supported this prediction, demonstrating that C2S-Scale can effectively guide the discovery of context-conditioned biology. C2S-Scale unifies transcriptomic and textual data at unprecedented scales, surpassing both specialized single-cell models and general-purpose LLMs to provide a platform for next-generation single-cell analysis and the development of “virtual cells.”",

Methods We uploaded a corpus of three thousand peer reviewed publications on these topics into the RAG. To address concerns about inaccurate responses and GPT ‘hallucinations’, we implemented a context provenance tracking mechanism that enables researchers to validate responses against the original material and to get references to the original papers. To assess the effectiveness of contextual information we collected evaluations and feedback from both domain expert users and ‘citizen scientists’ on the relevance of GPT responses. Results When evaluating the responses to their questions, human respondents give a “thumbs-up” 76% of the time. Meanwhile, RAGAS scores 90% on answer relevance on questions posed by experts. And when GPT generates questions, RAGAS scores 74% on answer relevance. Discussion A key innovation of our study is automated evaluation by way of a RAG assessment system (RAGAS). RAGAS combines human expert assessment with AI-driven evaluation to measure the effectiveness of RAG systems. With RAGAS, we created a benchmark that can be used to continuously assess our knowledge base's performance.

      "abstract": "Disease-associated genetic variants occur extensively in noncoding regions like promoters, but current methods focus primarily on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that typically have small regulatory effect sizes. Expanding beyond single nucleotide events is essential with insertions and deletions (indels) representing the logical next step as they are readily identifiable in population data and more likely to disrupt regulatory elements. However, existing methods struggle with indel prediction, and clinical interpretation often requires assessing complete promoter haplotypes rather than individual variants. We present LOL-EVE (Language Of Life for Evolutionary Variant Effects), a conditional autoregressive transformer trained on 13.6 million mammalian promoter sequences that enables both zero-shot indel prediction and complete promoter sequence scoring. We introduce three benchmarks for promoter indel prediction: ultra rare variant prioritization, causal eQTL identification, and transcription factor binding site disruption analysis. LOL-EVE’s superior performance demonstrates that evolutionary patterns learned from indels enable accurate assessment of broader promoter function. Application to Genomics England clinical data shows that LOL-EVE can prioritize promoter haplotypes in known developmental disorder genes, suggesting potential utility for clinical variant assessment. LOL-EVE bridges individual variant prediction with haplotype-level analysis, demonstrating how evolution-based genomic language models may assist in evaluating regulatory variants in complex genetic cases.",

Here, we propose Bering , a graph deep learning model that leverages transcript colocalization relationships for joint noise-aware cell segmentation and molecular annotation in 2D and 3D spatial transcriptomics data. Graph embeddings for the cell annotation are transferred as a component of multi-modal input for cell segmentation, which is employed to enrich gene relationships throughout the process. To evaluate performance, we benchmarked Bering with state-of-the-art methods and observed significant improvement in cell segmentation accuracies and numbers of detected transcripts across various spatial technologies and tissues.

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Obtaining positive and negative samples to examining several multifaceted brain diseases in clinical trials face significant challenges. We propose an innovative approach known as Adaptive Conditional Graph Diffusion Convolution (ACGDC) model. This model is tailored for the fusion of single cell multi-omics data and the creation of novel samples. ACGDC customizes a new array of edge relationship categories to merge single cell sequencing data and pertinent meta-information gleaned from annotations. Afterward, it employs network node properties and neighborhood topological connections to reconstruct the relationship between edges and their properties among nodes. Ultimately, it generates novel single-cell samples via inverse sampling within the framework of conditional diffusion model. To evaluate the credibility of the single cell samples generated through the new sampling approach, we conducted a comprehensive assessment. This assessment included comparisons between the generated samples and real samples across several criteria, including sample distribution space, enrichment analyses (GO term, KEGG term), clustering, and cell subtype classification, thereby allowing us to rigorously validate the quality and reliability of the single-cell samples produced by our novel sample method. The outcomes of our study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in seamlessly integrating single-cell multi-omics data and generating innovative samples that closely mirrored both the spatial distribution and bioinformatic significance observed in real samples. Thus, we suggest that the generation of these reliable control samples by ACGDC holds substantial promise in advancing precision research on brain diseases. Additionally, it offers a valuable tool for classifying and identifying astrocyte subtypes.",

To evaluate the capabilities of DLVPM, we initially trained a foundational model to map dependencies between SNV, Methylation, miRNA-Seq, RNA-Seq and Histological data using Breast Cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This method exhibited superior performance in mapping associations between data types compared to classical path modelling. We additionally performed successful applications of the model to: stratify single-cell data, identify synthetic lethal interactions using CRISPR-Cas9 screens derived from cell-lines, and detect histologic-transcriptional associations using spatial transcriptomic data.

The mechanisms for gene regulation are primarily encoded in noncoding DNA sequences, but deciphering how these sequence features control gene expression remains a significant challenge in genomics. Here, we present Nucleotide GPT, a transformer-based model that predicts genomic associations with spatially distinct, physical nuclear subcompartments from DNA sequence alone. Pre-trained on a diverse set of multi-species genomes, we demonstrate Nucleotide GPT’s genomic understanding through evaluation on diverse prediction tasks, including histone modifications, promoter detection, and transcription factor binding sites. When finetuned to predict genome interactions with two separate nuclear subcompartments – the lamina of the inner nuclear membrane and nuclear speckles that lie more interior – Nucleotide GPT achieves an average accuracy of 73.6% for lamina-associated domains (LADs) and 79.4% accuracy for speckle-associated domains (SPADs), averaged across three cortical development cell types. Analysis of the model’s learned representations through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) reveals that Nucleotide GPT develops internal embeddings that effectively distinguish LADs from inter-LADs, with predicted probabilities closely corresponding to experimentally determined LAD classifications. When examining these representations in the context of cell type-invariant constitutive LADs (cLADs) compared to cell type-specific LADs, the model assigns lower confidence scores to cell type-specific LADs compared to cLADs that are conserved across neuronal differentiation, suggesting sequence features may play a stronger role in maintaining cLAD associations. Examination of the model’s attention patterns at correctly classified regions suggests that specific sequence elements govern model decision making about nuclear subcompartment associations. Our results demonstrate the utility of transformer architectures for studying three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and substantiate a role for DNA sequence in determining nuclear subcompartment associations.",

      "abstract": "Language models starting from biological sequence data are advancing many inference problems, both at the scale of single proteins, and at the scale of genomic neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce ProteomeLM, a transformer-based language model that reasons on entire proteomes from species spanning the tree of life. Leveraging protein language model embeddings, ProteomeLM is trained to reconstruct masked protein embeddings using the whole proteomic context. It thus learns contextualized protein representations reflecting proteome-scale functional constraints. We show that ProteomeLM spontaneously captures protein-protein interactions (PPI) in its attention coefficients. We demonstrate that it screens whole interactomes orders of magnitude faster than amino-acid coevolution-based methods, and substantially outperforms them. We further develop ProteomeLM-PPI, a supervised PPI prediction network that combines ProteomeLM embeddings and attention coefficients, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across species and benchmarks. Finally, we introduce ProteomeLM-Ess, a supervised predictor of gene essentiality that generalizes across diverse taxa. Our results highlight the power of proteome-scale language models for addressing function and interactions at the organism level.",

      "abstract": "<h4>SUMMARY</h4>  Despite being heavily infiltrated by immune cells, tuberculosis (TB) granulomas often subvert the host response to  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and support bacterial persistence. We previously discovered that human TB granulomas are enriched for immunosuppressive factors typically associated with tumor-immune evasion, raising the intriguing possibility that they promote tolerance to infection. In this study, our goal was to identify the prime drivers for establishing this tolerogenic niche and to determine if the magnitude of this response correlates with bacterial persistence. To do this, we conducted a multimodal spatial analysis of 52 granulomas from 16 non-human primates (NHP) who were infected with low dose Mtb for 9-12 weeks. Notably, each granuloma’s bacterial burden was individually quantified allowing us to directly ask how granuloma spatial structure and function relate to infection control. We found that a universal feature of TB granulomas was partitioning of the myeloid core into two distinct metabolic environments, one of which is hypoxic. This hypoxic environment associated with pathologic immune cell states, dysfunctional cellular organization of the granuloma, and a near-complete blockade of lymphocyte infiltration that would be required for a successful host response. The extent of these hypoxia-associated features correlated with worsened bacterial burden. We conclude that hypoxia governs immune cell state and organization within granulomas and is a potent driver of subverted immunity during TB.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Multimodal survival analysis is essential for tackling the complexity of diseases such as glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive brain cancer with a dismal prognosis. While single-modality approaches exist, most fail to consider the combinatorial effects of multiple genetic variants or focus solely on aggregated gene expression data, neglecting critical nucleotide-level alterations. Current multimodal survival frameworks also exhibit significant limitations, such as disregarding sequence-level RNA information and failing to retain spatial context in histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides. To address these challenges, we developed MUSA, a novel deep learning–based survival model that integrates four complementary data streams: (1) a hierarchical transformer module for extracting base-level RNA sequence alterations, (2) an unsupervised convolutional neural network pipeline for preserving spatial features in H&E whole-slide images, (3) gene expression profiling, and (4) clinical records. By unifying these modalities through a late-fusion mechanism, MUSA significantly outperforms single-modality and existing multimodal approaches, achieving higher AUC scores and more robust patient stratification on a GBM dataset. This innovative multimodal framework, along with its specialized feature extraction techniques, provides a foundation for more precise and clinically actionable survival predictions in glioblastoma.</p>",

This study evaluates five strategies for integrating metabolomics data from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Deep Transfer Learning and Multiple Kernel Learning demonstrated superior performance, significantly improving classification accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness compared to single-modality analyses. Deep Transfer Learning employed a custom autoencoder for feature extraction followed by artificial neural network classification, while Multiple Kernel Learning optimized kernel matrices across different modalities. Feature extraction in the Deep Transfer Learning approach, combined with the selection of important features and subsequent analysis, revealed elevated levels of monounsaturated phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine 30:1, phosphatidylethanolamine 32:1, and sphingomyelin 32:1 in HER2-positive cases. Additionally, β-alanine, gluconic acid, and N-acetylaspartic acid were increased, whereas 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine and nicotinamide were decreased.

      "abstract": "Due to its internal state or external environment, a cell’s gene expression profile contains multiple signatures, simultaneously encoding information about its characteristics. Disentangling these factors of variations from single-cell data is needed to recover multiple layers of biological information and extract insight into the individual and collective behavior of cellular populations. While several recent methods were suggested for biological disentanglement, each has its limitations; they are either task-specific, cannot capture inherent nonlinear or interaction effects, cannot integrate layers of experimental data, or do not provide a general reconstruction procedure. We present biolord , a deep generative framework for disentangling known and unknown attributes in single-cell data. Biolord exposes the distinct effects of different biological processes or tissue structure on cellular gene expression. Based on that, biolord allows generating experimentally-inaccessible cell states by virtually shifting cells across time, space, and biological states. Specifically, we showcase accurate predictions of cellular responses to drug perturbations and generalization to predict responses to unseen drugs. Further, biolord disentangles spatial, temporal, and infection-related attributes and their associated gene expression signatures in a single-cell atlas of Plasmodium infection progression in the mouse liver. Biolord can handle partially labeled attributes by predicting a classification for missing labels, and hence can be used to computationally extend an infected hepatocyte population identified at a late stage of the infection to earlier stages. Biolord applies to diverse biological settings, is implemented using the scvi-tools library, and is released as open-source software at https://github.com/nitzanlab/biolord .",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> While early prostate cancer (PCa) depends on the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, which is predominant in luminal cells, there is much to be understood about the contribution of epithelial basal cells in cancer progression. Herein, we observe cell-type specific differences in the importance of the metabolic enzyme phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase alpha (PI5P4Kα; gene name PIP4K2A ) in the prostate epithelium. We report the development of a basal-cell-specific genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) targeting Pip4k2a alone or in combination with the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog ( Pten ). PI5P4Kα is enriched in basal cells, and no major histopathological changes were detectable following gene deletion. Notably, the combined loss of Pip4k2a slowed the development of Pten mutant mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). Through the inclusion of a lineage tracing reporter, we utilize single-cell RNA sequencing to evaluate changes resulting from in vivo downregulation of Pip4k2a and characterize cell populations influenced in the established Probasin-Cre and Cytokeratin 5 (CK5)- Cre driven GEMMs. Transcriptomic pathway analysis points towards the disruption of lipid metabolism as a mechanism for reduced tumor progression. This was functionally supported by shifts of carnitine lipids in LNCaP PCa cells treated with siPIP4K2A . Overall, these data nominate PI5P4Kα as a target for PTEN mutant PCa. <h4>One Sentence Summary</h4> Loss of PI5P4Kα slows cancer progression in prostate basal cells.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Insights and discoveries in complex biological systems, e.g. for personalized medicine, are gained by the combination of large, feature-rich and high-dimensional data with powerful computational methods uncovering patterns and relationships. In recent years, autoencoders, a family of deep learning-based methods for representation learning, are advancing data-driven research due to their variability and non-linear power of multi-modal data integration. Despite their success, current implementations lack standardization, versatility, comparability, and generalizability preventing a broad application. To fill the gap, we present AUTOENCODIX ( https://github.com/jan-forest/autoencodix ), an open-source framework, designed as a standardized and flexible pipeline for preprocessing, training, and evaluation of autoencoder architectures. These architectures, like ontology-based and cross-modal autoencoders, provide key advantages over traditional methods via explainability of embeddings or the ability to translate across data modalities. We show the value of our framework by its application to data sets from pan-cancer studies (TCGA), single-cell sequencing as well as in combination with imaging. Our studies provide important user-centric insights and recommendations to navigate through architectures, hyperparameters, and important trade-offs in representation learning. Those include reconstruction capability of input data, the quality of embedding for downstream machine learning models, or the reliability of ontology-based embeddings for explainability. In summary, our versatile and generalizable framework allows multi-modal data integration in biomedical research and any other data-driven fields of research. Hence, it can serve as a open-source platform for several major trends and research using autoencoders including architectural improvements, explainability, or training of large-scale pre-trained models.",

To address this gap, this study investigates the current state of research and key application areas of radiomics in lung cancer, while predicting future research directions.<bold>Methods</bold> On 21 October, 2024, we identified 2057 papers on the application of radiomics in lung cancer from the Web of Science database Core Collection database. In order to examine and graph trends and proportions of publications by country, GraphPad Prism software was used. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to visualize and analyze the papers published from 1 January 2010 to 21 October 2024.<bold>Results</bold> The collection included 2057 papers published from 2010 to 2024, of which most were articles (1734, 84.30%) and a few were reviews (323, 15.70%), contributed by 9539 authors from 61 countries/regions. There was an upward trend in both the number of publications per year and the total number of citations. China, accounting for 47.79% with 983 papers, and the USA, accounting for 25.86% with 532 papers, have made notable contributions in this domain. General Electric was the most productive institution (n = 86). Lambin (n = 919 citations) was the most co-cited author, whereas Aerts, Hugo J. W. L., was placed first among the top ten authors. The most published journal was Frontiers in Oncology (178 publications; IF 2023, 3.5; Q2). It is important for different countries and institutions to strengthen their cooperation in the future. Radiomics, features, images, CT, and survival were the most commonly used keywords. The analysis of references and keywords shows that the research hotspot of lung cancer radiomics is more inclined towards clinical applications. In the future, radiomics was mainly used for the classification, diagnosis, detection, and prediction of lung cancer, especially in immunotherapy.<bold>Conclusion</bold> In summary, the bibliometric analysis comprehensively and quantitatively presents the research status, research hotspots, and development trends of radiomics applied in lung cancer. The application of radiomics to lung cancer is a highly promising research area based on our results. Multicenter studies are a trend in the development of lung cancer radiomics, and we advocate strengthening cooperation between countries/regions, institutions, and authors to break down academic barriers. The research hotspot of lung cancer radiomics is more inclined towards clinical applications, including screening, diagnosis, and prediction of clinical outcome. Immunotherapy is currently a hot research area in this field, and the efficacy and prognosis of personalized immunotherapy for lung cancer is the future development trend. Furthermore, deep learning can provide strong technical support for radiomics. Multimodal learning for information fusion is another crucial development trend; we should pay more attention to multi-omics integration in the future.</p>",

      "abstract": "Advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have provided unprecedented opportunities to depict transcriptomic and histological landscapes in the spatial context. Multi-modal ST data provide abundant and comprehensive information about cellular status, function, and organization. However, in dealing with the processing and analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, existing algorithms struggle to effectively fuse the multi-modal information contained within ST data. Here, we propose a graph contrastive learning-based cross-modality fusion model named stGCL for accurate and robust integrating gene expression, spatial information as well as histological profiles simultaneously. stGCL adopts a novel histology-based Vision Transformer (H-ViT) method to effectively encode histological features and combines multi-modal graph attention auto-encoder (GATE) with contrastive learning to fuse cross-modality features. In addition, stGCL introduces a pioneering spatial coordinate correcting and registering strategy for tissue slices integration, which can reduce batch effects and identify cross-sectional domains precisely. Compared with state-of-the-art methods on spatial transcriptomics data across platforms and resolutions, stGCL achieves a superior clustering performance and is more robust in unraveling spatial patterns of biological significance. Additionally, stGCL successfully reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) brain tissue structures by integrating vertical and horizontal slices respectively. Application of stGCL in human bronchiolar adenoma (BA) data reveals intratumor spatial heterogeneity and identifies candidate gene biomarkers. In summary, stGCL enables the fusion of various spatial modality data and is a powerful tool for analytical tasks such as spatial domain identification and multi-slice integration.",

We have generalised scMerge2 to enable the merging of millions of cells from single-cell studies generated by various single-cell technologies. Using a large COVID-19 data collection with over five million cells from 1000+ individuals, we demonstrate that scMerge2 enables multi-sample multi-condition scRNA-seq data integration from multiple cohorts and reveals signatures derived from cell-type expression that are more accurate in discriminating disease progression. Further, we demonstrate that scMerge2 can remove dataset variability in CyTOF, imaging mass cytometry and CITE-seq experiments, demonstrating its applicability to a broad spectrum of single-cell profiling technologies.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal data is rapidly growing in many fields of science and engineering, including single-cell biology. We introduce MultiMAP, an approach for dimensionality reduction and integration of multiple datasets. MultiMAP recovers a single manifold on which all of the data resides and then projects the data into a single low-dimensional space so as to preserve the structure of the manifold. It is based on a framework of Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology, and generalizes the popular UMAP algorithm 1 to the multimodal setting. MultiMAP can be used for visualization of multimodal data, and as an integration approach that enables joint analyses. MultiMAP has several advantages over existing integration strategies for single-cell data, including that MultiMAP can integrate any number of datasets, leverages features that are not present in all datasets (i.e. datasets can be of different dimensionalities), is not restricted to a linear mapping, can control the influence of each dataset on the embedding, and is extremely scalable to large datasets. We apply MultiMAP to the integration of a variety of single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, methylation, and spatial data, and show that it outperforms current approaches in preservation of high-dimensional structure, alignment of datasets, visual separation of clusters, transfer learning, and runtime. On a newly generated single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset of the human thymus, we use MultiMAP to integrate cells along a temporal trajectory. This enables the quantitative comparison of transcription factor expression and binding site accessibility over the course of T cell differentiation, revealing patterns of transcription factor kinetics.",

We present  Tahoe-x1 (Tx1), a family of perturbation-trained single-cell foundation models with up to 3 billion parameters. Tx1 is pretrained on large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets, including the  Tahoe-100M perturbation compendium, and fine-tuned for cancer-relevant tasks. Through architectural optimizations, data loader refinements, and efficient training strategies, Tx1 achieves 3–30× higher compute efficiency than prior implementations of cell-state models. Tx1 jointly learns representations of genes, cells, and compounds using a masked-expression generative objective that incorporates a drug token, enabling flexible adaptation to diverse downstream applications. We evaluate Tx1 across four key disease-relevant benchmarks: (1) prediction of overall and context-specific gene essentiality, (2) identification of genes contributing to the hallmarks of cancer, (3) cell-type classification, and (4) prediction of perturbation responses in held-out cellular contexts. Tx1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.

Drawing inspiration from the translation procedure of both natural language processing (NLP) and the genetic central dogma, we propose a pre-trained, large generative model named scTranslator (single-cell translator). scTranslator is align-free and capable of generating multi-omics data by inferring the missing single-cell proteome based on the transcriptome. Systematic benchmarking confirms the accuracy, stability, and flexibility of scTranslator across various quantification techniques, cell types, and conditions.

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Enabled by the explosion of data and substantial increase in computational power, deep learning has transformed fields such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) and it has become a successful method to be applied to many transcriptomic analysis tasks. A core advantage of deep learning is its inherent capability to incorporate feature computation within the machine learning models. This results in a comprehensive and machine-readable representation of sequences, facilitating the downstream classification and clustering tasks. Compared to machine translation problems in NLP, feature embedding is particularly challenging for transcriptomic studies as the sequences are string of thousands of nucleotides in length, which make the long-term dependencies between features from different parts of the sequence even more difficult to capture. This highlights the need for nucleotide sequence embedding methods that are capable of learning input sequence features implicitly. Here we introduce ntEmbd, a deep learning embedding tool that captures dependencies between different features of the sequences and learns a latent representation for given nucleotide sequences. We further provide two sample use cases, describing how learned RNA features can be used in downstream analysis. The first use case demonstrates ntEmbd ’ s utility in classifying coding and noncoding RNA benchmarked against existing tools, and the second one explores the utility of learned representations in identifying adapter sequences in nanopore RNA-seq reads. The tool as well as the trained models are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/bcgsc/ntEmbd",

      "title": "Integrating single-cell RNA-seq datasets with substantial batch effects",
      "abstract": "Integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets has become a standard part of the analysis, with conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) being among the most popular approaches. Increasingly, researchers are asking to map cells across challenging cases such as cross-organs, species, or organoids and primary tissue, as well as different scRNA-seq protocols, including single-cell and single-nuclei. Current computational methods struggle to harmonize datasets with such substantial differences, driven by technical or biological variation. Here, we propose to address these challenges for the popular cVAE-based approaches by introducing and comparing a series of regularization constraints. The two commonly used strategies for increasing batch correction in cVAEs, that is Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) regularization strength tuning and adversarial learning, suffer from substantial loss of biological information. Therefore, we adapt, implement, and assess alternative regularization strategies for cVAEs and investigate how they improve batch effect removal or better preserve biological variation, enabling us to propose an optimal cVAE-based integration strategy for complex systems. We show that using a VampPrior instead of the commonly used Gaussian prior not only improves the preservation of biological variation but also unexpectedly batch correction. Moreover, we show that our implementation of cycle-consistency loss leads to significantly better biological preservation than adversarial learning implemented in the previously proposed GLUE model. Additionally, we do not recommend relying only on the KL regularization strength tuning for increasing batch correction, as it removes both biological and batch information without discriminating between the two. Based on our findings, we propose a new model that combines VampPrior and cycle-consistency loss. We show that using it for datasets with substantial batch effects improves downstream interpretation of cell states and biological conditions. To ease the use of the newly proposed model, we make it available in the scvi-tools package as an external model named sysVI. Moreover, in the future, these regularization techniques could be added to other established cVAE-based models to improve the integration of datasets with substantial batch effects.",

      "title": "VADEr: Vision Transformer-Inspired Framework for Polygenic Risk Reveals Underlying Genetic Heterogeneity in Prostate Cancer",
      "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) serve as quantitative metrics of genetic liability for various conditions. Traditionally calculated as an effect size weighted genotype summation, this formulation assumes conditional feature independence and overlooks the potential for complex interactions among genetic variants. Transformers, a class of deep learning architectures known for capturing dependencies between features, have demonstrated remarkable predictive power across domains. In this work, we introduce VADEr, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-inspired architecture that combines techniques from both natural language processing and computer vision to capture properties exhibited by genetic data and model local and global interactions for genotype-to-phenotype prediction. Evaluating VADEr's performance in predicting prostate cancer (PCa) risk, we found that across a range of metrics, including accuracy, average precision, and Matthews correlation coefficient, VADEr outperformed all benchmark methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in the context of complex disease risk prediction. To illuminate identified drivers of disease risk by VADEr, we formulated DARTH scores, an attention-based attribution metric, to capture the personalized contribution of each genomic region. These scores revealed distinct genetic heterogeneity captured by VADEr, with drivers of predicted risk identified in key PCa risk regions including the HOXB13, TMPRSS2, and MSMB loci. DARTH scores also revealed germline predispositions for particular PCa molecular subtypes, including an association between the LMTK2 locus and the SPOP subtype, both implicated in the regulation of androgen receptor activity. Overall, by effectively capturing dependencies among genetic variants and providing interpretable insights, VADEr and DARTH scores offer a promising direction for advancing genotype-to-phenotype prediction, particularly in complex disease.",

      "abstract": "Although an essential step, the functional annotation of cells often proves particularly challenging in the analysis of single-cell transcriptional data. Several methods have been developed to accomplish this task. However, in most cases, these rely on techniques initially developed for bulk RNA sequencing or simply make use of marker genes identified from cell clustering followed by supervised annotation. To overcome these limitations and automatise the process, we have developed two novel methods, the single-cell gene set enrichment analysis (scGSEA) and the single cell mapper (scMAP). scGSEA combines latent data representations and gene set enrichment scores to detect coordinated gene activity at single-cell resolution. scMAP uses transfer learning techniques to repurpose and contextualise new cells into a reference cell atlas. Using both simulated and real datasets, we show that scGSEA effectively recapitulates recurrent patterns of pathways’ activity shared by cells from different experimental conditions. At the same time, we show that scMAP can reliably map and contextualise new single cell profiles on a breast cancer atlas we recently released. Both tools are provided in an effective and straightforward workflow providing a framework to determine cell function and significantly improve annotation and interpretation of scRNA-seq data.",

We present GLM-Prior, a genomic language model fine-tuned to predict transcription factor–target gene in-teractions directly from nucleotide sequence. We integrate GLM-Prior with PMF-GRN, a probabilistic matrix factorization model, to create a dual-stage pipeline that combines sequence-derived priors with single-cell gene expression data for GRN inference. Across six human, mouse, and yeast cell lines, GLM-Prior performance scales with positive label abundance and diverse transcription factor coverage, achieving strong accuracy in well-annotated mammalian contexts. We evaluate single-species, species-transfer learning, and multi-species training paradigms and show that GLM-Prior generalizes to held-out gene and TF sequences, enabling experiment-agnostic prior construction in previously unprofiled contexts. Furthermore, comparisons to accessibility-based priors across multiple GRN inference methods show that GLM-Prior provides the most robust priors in mammalian cell lines. Together, our results demonstrate that prior construction, rather than the choice of GRN inference algorithm, is the primary determinant of GRN inference performance, and establish GLM-Prior as a framework for building high-quality, experiment-agnostic priors that can be deployed even in understudied or experimentally inaccessible systems.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of genomic and metagenomic data has underscored the pressing need for advanced computational tools capable of deciphering complex biological sequences. In this study, we introduce Gener anno , a compact yet powerful genomic foundation model (GFM) specifically optimized for metagenomic annotation. Trained on an extensive dataset comprising 715 billion base pairs (bp) of prokaryotic DNA, Gener anno employs a transformer encoder architecture with 500 million parameters, enabling bidirectional attention over sequences up to 8192 bp at single-nucleotide resolution. This design addresses key limitations of existing methods, including the inability of traditional Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to handle fragmented DNA sequences from multi-species microbial communities, as well as the suboptimal tokenization schemes of existing GFMs that compromise fine-grained analysis. At its core, Gener anno excels in identifying coding regions from fragmented and mixed DNA sequences—a hallmark of metagenomic analysis. It achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional HMM-based methods (e.g., GLIMMER3, GeneMarkS2, Prodigal) and recent LLM-based approaches (e.g., GeneLM), while demonstrating robust generalization ability on archaeal genomes. Leveraging its advanced contextual understanding capability, Gener anno further enables two essential functions: pseudogene prediction and taxonomic classification—both performed based solely on raw sequence data, without reliance on reference databases or comparative genomics. These functionalities collectively streamline the metagenomic analysis pipeline, significantly reducing preprocessing requirements and enabling end-to-end interpretation of sequencing data. Beyond its primary role in metagenomic annotation, Gener anno also serves as a powerful GFM. To evaluate its broader utility, we curated the Prokaryotic Gener Tasks—a comprehensive benchmark suite specifically tailored for prokaryotic genomic analysis. It includes gene fitness prediction, antibiotic resistance identification, gene classification, and taxonomic classification, reflecting diverse aspects of functional genomics. On this benchmark, Gener anno consistently outperforms existing GFMs such as DNABERT-2, NT-v2, and GenomeOcean, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of genomic tasks. Overall, Gener anno provides a unified framework that integrates multiple critical functions for metagenomic annotation and beyond. By eliminating dependencies on external resources and offering rich contextual understanding of genomic sequences, this work delivers a foundational tool for advancing functional genomics in complex microbial communities.

We also constructed a single-cell trimodal atlas of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and tailored transfer learning and reciprocal reference mapping schemes to enable flexible and accurate knowledge transfer from the atlas to new data.

      "title": "The HeartMagic prospective observational study protocol – characterizing subtypes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction",
      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>  Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality. While evidence-based drug treatments have effectively reduced morbidity and mortality in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), few therapies have been demonstrated to improve outcomes in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The multifaceted clinical presentation is one of the main reasons why the current understanding of HFpEF remains limited. This may be caused by the existence of several HFpEF disease subtypes that each need different treatments. There is therefore an unmet need for a holistic approach that combines comprehensive imaging with metabolomic, transcriptomic and genomic mapping to subtype HFpEF patients. This protocol details the approach employed in the HeartMagic study to address this gap in understanding. <h4>Methods</h4>  This prospective multi-center observational cohort study will include 500 consecutive patients with actual or recent hospitalization for treatment of HFpEF at two Swiss university hospitals, along with 50 age-matched HFrEF patients and 50 age-matched healthy controls. Diagnosis of heart failure is based on clinical signs and symptoms and subgrouping HF patients is based on the left-ventricular ejection fraction. In addition to routine clinical workup, participants undergo genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, while the anatomy, composition, and function of the heart are quantified by comprehensive echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative MRI is also applied to characterize the kidney. The primary outcome is a composite of one-year cardiovascular mortality or rehospitalization. Machine learning (ML) based multi-modal clustering will be employed to identify distinct HFpEF subtypes in the holistic data. The clinical importance of these subtypes shall be evaluated based on their association with the primary outcome. Statistical analysis will include group comparisons across modalities, survival analysis for the primary outcome, and integrative multi-modal clustering combining clinical, imaging, ECG, genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data to identify and validate HFpEF subtypes. <h4>Discussion</h4>  The integration of comprehensive MRI with extensive genomic and metabolomic profiling in this study will result in an unprecedented panoramic view of HFpEF and should enable us to distinguish functional subgroups of HFpEF patients. This approach has the potential to provide unprecedented insights on HFpEF disease and should provide a basis for personalized therapies. Beyond this, identifying HFpEF subtypes with specific molecular and structural characteristics could lead to new targeted pharmacological interventions, with the potential to improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The growth of a tumor is tightly linked to the distribution of its cells along a continuum of activation states. Here, we systematically decode the activation state architecture (ASA) in a glioblastoma (GBM) patient cohort through comparison to adult murine neural stem cells. Modelling of these data forecast how tumor cells organize to sustain growth and identifies rate of activation as the main predictor of growth. Accordingly, patients with a higher quiescence fraction exhibit improved outcomes. Further, DNA methylation arrays enable ASA-related patient stratification. Comparison of healthy and malignant gene expression dynamics reveals dysregulation of the Wnt-antagonist SFRP1 at the quiescence to activation transition. SFRP1 overexpression renders GBM quiescent and increases overall survival of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, it does so through reprogramming the tumor's stem-like methylome into an astrocyte-like one. Our findings offer a novel patient stratification with clinical impact, new biomarkers and therapeutic avenues to halt GBM progression.",

However, robust cell alignment remains a major challenge for data integration and harmonization, including batch correction, label transfer, and multiomics integration. Many existing methods constrain alignment based on rigid feature-wise distance metrics, limiting their ability to capture accurate cell correspondence across diverse cell populations and conditions. We introduce scGALA, a graph-based learning framework that redefines cell alignment by combining graph attention networks with a score-driven, task-independent optimization strategy. scGALA constructs enriched graphs of cell–cell relationships by integrating gene expression profiles with auxiliary information such as spatial coordinates and iteratively refines alignment via self-supervised graph link prediction, where a deep neural network is trained to identify and reinforce high-confidence correspondences across datasets. In extensive benchmarks, scGALA identifies over 25 percent more high-confidence alignments without compromising accuracy. By improving the core step of cell alignment, scGALA serves as a versatile enhancer for a wide range of single-cell data integration tasks.</p>",

      "abstract": "Single-cell omics enable the dissection of cellular heterogeneity, yet the high dimensionality, inherent noise, and sparsity present significant challenges. These challenges are amplified for rare cell populations, which are often difficult to annotate reliably but can be central to development and disease. As single-cell assays increasingly capture multiple molecular layers, the integrative analysis of such multimodal data further increases complexity. Here, we propose Hydra, a deep generative framework based on an ensemble of variational autoencoders for effective learning of unimodal and multimodal single-cell omics data. Hydra implements interpretable modules for capturing cell type-specific molecular signatures. The ensemble of such interpretable modules enables reproducible feature selection and robust cell type annotation, with particular effectiveness for rare populations. We benchmarked Hydra on a repertoire of 21 datasets, including unimodal and multimodal single-cell omics data. Our results demonstrate that Hydra offers comparable to superior performance to several state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we highlight the utility of Hydra in robustly annotating brain cellular subtypes and preserving disease-relevant signatures using our previously published dataset that profiles Alzheimer’s disease.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Peptide-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate critical physiological processes such as metabolism, neural signalling, and endocrine function through their interaction with neuropeptides and peptide hormones. Despite their importance, identifying endogenous peptide agonists for GPCRs remains challenging, particularly for orphan receptors without known ligands. Recent advances in deep learning-based protein structure prediction, exemplified by AlphaFold (AF), have shown application beyond structural modelling, including protein-protein interaction prediction. Given that GPCR-peptide agonist interactions represent a specialized form of protein-protein interaction, we leveraged a dataset of experimentally validated agonist and non-agonist GPCR-peptide interactions from Caenorhabditis elegans to evaluate AF-Multimer’s ability to distinguish agonist-bound complexes. When modelling GPCR-peptide complexes, AF-Multimer confidence metrics partially discriminate agonist from non-agonist interactions, with improved discrimination achieved by utilizing AF-Multistate-derived active-state templates. We further investigated whether embeddings from the hidden layer of AF-Multimer’s neural network could distinguish agonist from non-agonist complexes. Feature performance analysis reveals that AF- Multimer’s pair representations outperform single representations, with distinct subregions of the pair representation providing complementary predictive signals. Building on these insights, we developed DeorphaNN, a graph neural network integrating active-state GPCR-peptide structural predictions, interatomic interactions, and deep learning embeddings to prioritize GPCR-peptide agonist interactions. DeorphaNN generalizes across datasets derived from different species, including annelids and humans, and successfully uncovered peptide agonists for two orphan GPCRs. DeorphaNN offers a novel computational resource to accelerate deorphanization by prioritizing GPCR-peptide agonist candidates for AI-guided experimental validation.",

      "abstract": "Biological systems can be interrogated by perturbing individual components and observing the consequences across molecular, cellular, and phenotypic levels. The vast combinatorial space of possible perturbations and responses makes exhaustive experimentation infeasible. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that training on diverse datasets enables transfer learning across tasks, capturing patterns that generalize and improving performance on previously unseen problems. Inspired by this principle, we present Prophet, a transformer-based model pretrained on a vast, heterogeneous collection of perturbation experiments. This pretraining allows Prophet to predict the outcomes of untested genetic or chemical perturbations in novel cellular contexts, spanning phenotypes such as gene expression, viability, and morphology. By leveraging shared structure across apparently disconnected assays, Prophet provides a scalable framework for large-scale virtual screening and prioritization of informative experiments. Prophet consistently outperforms baseline models, including those trained on single phenotypes, showing that transfer learning between phenotypes not only is possible but improves predictive accuracy. Its capabilities extends to in vivo developmental systems, where it recapitulates known lineage biology and proposes new candidates. In a large-scale in silico screen for melanoma, Prophet identified and experimentally validated compounds with selective activity that mirrored clinically approved therapies, demonstrating its ability to transform perturbation biology into a predictive and scalable engine for therapeutic discovery.",

While these communities, defined as cell niches, are fundamentally shaped by interactions between spatially neighboring cells, we lack computational frameworks that can leverage spatial omics data to quantitatively characterize niches based on cell interaction events. To address this, we introduce NicheCompass, a graph deep learning method designed based on the principles of cellular communication. NicheCompass not only identifies cell niches, but also learns and informs about the signaling events shaping the identity of these niches. Unlike existing methods, it uniquely characterizes niches by quantifying their activity of spatial gene programs which represent diverse mechanisms of cell-cell communication and transcriptional regulation, thereby uncovering the underlying cellular processes constituting each niche. We showcase a comprehensive workflow encompassing data integration, niche identification, and functional interpretation, and demonstrate that, with its biologically informed design, NicheCompass outperforms existing methods. NicheCompass is broadly applicable to spatial transcriptomics data, which we illustrate by mapping the architecture of diverse tissues during mouse embryonic development, and delineating basal (KRT14) and luminal (KRT8) tumor niches in human breast cancer. We further introduce fine-tuning-based spatial reference mapping, revealing an SPP1+ macrophage-dominated tumor niche in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Additionally, we extend NicheCompass to multimodal spatial profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, identifying and characterizing distinct white matter niches in the mouse brain. Finally, we apply NicheCompass to a whole mouse brain spatial atlas with 8.4 million cells demonstrating its scalability and ability to build foundational, interpretable spatial representations for entire organs. Overall, NicheCompass provides a novel approach to the challenge of identifying and analyzing niches, and suggests a more rigorous niche definition grounded in the quantitative characterization of underlying cellular processes.",

Applications to tissue specimens across a broad array of pathologies have enabled patient subtyping in terms of novel cell states and spatial cell communities and linked their prevalence and overall architecture to patient outcomes. While highly multiplexed imaging analysis workflows typically summarize each cell in terms of its post-segmentation mean expression, additional cellular information can be quantified including cell morphology, sub-cellular expression patterns, and spatial cellular context, ultimately giving a multi-modal view of each cell. While deep latent variable models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) are well established for other multi-modal single-cell assays, their ability to integrate these multiple views of a cell from highly multiplexed imaging data remains largely unknown. Here, we explore the abilities of multi-modal VAEs to learn unified latent cellular representations from multiple views of each single-cell quantified from highly multiplexed imaging, including mean expression, morphology, sub-cellular protein co-localization, and spatial cellular context, while conditioning on technical and batch specific effects. We first discuss strategies for training and hyperparameter optimization of such models across a set of highly multiplexed imaging datasets of breast and melanoma cancers. We next quantify the relevance of the integrated multi-modal latent space in predicting patient-specific clinical outcomes and demonstrate competitive performance across a range of outcomes compared to existing baselines. Then, we explore the ability of the cellular representations to learn cellular phenotypes that align with known cell types and find that the expression-specific latent representation can identify clusters more closely aligned with known lymphocyte and epithelial subpopulations compared to established workflows. Finally, we test the ability of each representation to perform consistent batch integration across different cohorts and discuss the considerations on taking known background variables into account.",

However, identifying cognate epitopes for individual TCRs requires complex and costly functional assays. We address this challenge with EpitopeGen, a large-scale transformer model based on the GPT-2 architecture that generates potential cognate epitope sequences directly from TCR sequences. To overcome the scarcity of TCR-epitope binding pairs (≈ 100,000), EpitopeGen uses a semi-supervised learning method, termed BINDSEARCH, which searches over 70 billion potential pairs and incorporates high binding affinity predictions as pseudo-labels. To incorporate CD8 + T cell biology into the model as an inductive bias, EpitopeGen employs a novel data balancing method, termed Antigen Category Filter, that carefully controls antigen category ratios in its training dataset. EpitopeGen significantly outperforms baseline approaches, generating epitopes with high binding affinity, diversity, naturalness, and biophysical stability. Notably, the epitopes generated by EpitopeGen follow biologically plausible antigen category distributions, a crucial feature not achieved by other models. Using EpitopeGen, we directly identify subsets of clonally expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that recognize tumor-associated antigens, exhibiting elevated cytotoxicity and reduced exhaustion markers. From COVID-19 patients, EpitopeGen detects T cells that recognize COVID-19 spike proteins and non-structural proteins with distinct transcriptomic characteristics.

However, current LLMs for genomics suffer from several limitations such as the inability to include chromatin interactions in the training data, and the inability to make prediction in new cellular contexts not represented in the training data. To mitigate these problems, we propose EpiGePT, a transformer-based pretrained language model for predicting context-specific epigenomic signals and chromatin contacts.

      "title": "Fundamental Limitations of Foundation Models in Single-Cell Transcriptomics",
      "abstract": "Recent applications of foundation models in biology have focused on pretraining using large-scale single-cell datasets comprising millions of cells, across diverse patho-physiological states. These models are then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as cell-type classification. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three widely-used foundation models in biology—scGPT, SCMAMBA-2, and Geneformer—and a statistical baseline (Seurat v5) on cell-type classification under Gaussian noise perturbation. We used two curated datasets, referred to as Myeloid (13k cells) and hPancreas (15k cells). Surprisingly, we found that the baseline performance of the foundation models was inferior to that of the statistical model, even without any added perturbation. Although we note that model size can affect performance, Geneformer’s accuracy outperformed scGPT and SCMAMBA-2 by 5% on average across all datasets despite having 40% fewer trainable parameters. Nonetheless, the statistical baseline still outperformed Geneformer by 9% in accuracy. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the conventional training paradigm used by foundation models for single-cell tasks consistently underperforms statistical models due to a lack of essential biological context. To investigate this, we evaluated whether performance degradation stems from early data embedding steps—such as binning or gene normalization during tokenization, and sampling bias. First, to better understand tokenization-related artifacts, we introduced controlled Gaussian noise to gene expression values before tokenization, amplifying downstream distortions introduced by the tokenization process (all models were trained for identical step durations with identical hyperparameters). On the Myeloid dataset, following the introduction of Gaussian noise perturbation to 20% of cells, both scGPT and SCMAMBA-2 saw an 11% decrease in accuracy while Geneformer saw an 8% decrease in accuracy. This difference in performance may be due to the difference in encoding methods used by both models. scGPT and SCMAMBA-2 use a bin-based tokenization strategy, in contrast to Geneformer’s rank-value encoding, which normalizes gene expression values using a predetermined encoding constant. Although binning captures general trends in count data, it fails to preserve relative expression at the gene level, resulting in significant information loss. Applying the three models to the Myeloid dataset also revealed that scGPT’s prediction distribution is biased toward overrepresented cell types in the training data, while underrepresenting rarer classes. CD14 cells are overpredicted by 16% (among most abundant cell types) by scGPT. Geneformer, however, maintains a more stable prediction distribution with a 6% (CD14) increase and outperforms scGPT and SCMAMBA-2 by 26% in macro F1 score (unweighted metric). Based on our findings we assert that the gap in contextual encoding in bin-based tokenization is what contributes to the less-nuanced learning. Recent research that integrated cellular-ontology during training showed improved performance to both scGPT and Geneformer. Our results underscore a fundamental issue, that foundation models lack critical biological context that would allow for them to make the nuanced inferences required for complex biological analyses. The compression of single-cell data from raw counts to embedding vectors can span several orders of magnitude, and lead to significant loss of information. As a result, methods must adapt to prioritize contextual integration during tokenization to ensure sufficient information for the model.",

      "title": "Immune infiltration is linked to increased transcriptional activity and distinct metabolic profiles in chordomas",
      "abstract": "Chordomas are ultra-rare cancers from the axial skeleton with limited treatment options. Chordomas can exhibit immunogenic features, and immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated clinical activity in some patients, yet the determinants of these responses remain poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate the biological basis of immunogenicity in chordomas through spatial transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. We applied GeoMx digital spatial profiling to 15 chordomas, analyzing tumor and stromal compartments separately and comparing inflamed and non-inflamed tumors. Consecutive tissue sections were examined using MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) at 20 µm spatial resolution. Findings were further explored through immunohistochemistry analyses. To assess whether transcriptional activity in tumor cells was associated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling, we tested the effect of IFN-γ treatment on chordoma cell lines. Digital spatial profiling of inflamed and non-inflamed chordomas revealed striking differences in both the cancer cell and stromal compartments. Increased immune infiltration was strongly associated with elevated transcriptional activity in cancer cells. MALDI-MSI revealed distinct metabolic signatures and pronounced glycogen accumulation in inflamed chordomas. Nevertheless, IFN-γ stimulation of chordoma cell lines did not induce expression of  TBXT (brachyury), the master transcriptional regulator of chordoma biology.  Collectively, our findings reveal a strong association between the transcriptomic and metabolic activity in chordomas and their immunogenicity. However, the causal direction of this relationship remains to be determined. Nevertheless, these findings are highly relevant for patient stratification, particularly in the context of immunotherapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "<h4>A bstract </h4> Generative pre-trained models, such as BERT and GPT, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision. Leveraging the combination of large-scale, diverse datasets, transformers, and unsupervised learning, these models have emerged as a promising method for understanding complex systems like language. Despite the apparent differences, human language and biological systems share numerous parallels. Biology, like language, is a dynamic, interconnected network where biomolecules interact to create living entities akin to words forming coherent narratives. Inspired by this analogy, we explored the potential of using transformer-based unsupervised model development for analyzing biological systems and proposed a framework that can ingest vast amounts of biological data to create a foundational model of biology using BERT or GPT. This framework focuses on the concept of a ‘biostate,’ defined as a high-dimensional vector encompassing various biological markers such as genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, physiological, and phenotypical data. We applied this technique to a small dataset of single-cell transcriptomics to demonstrate its ability to capture meaningful biological insights into genes and cells, even without any pre-training. Furthermore, the model can be readily used for gene network inference and genetic perturbation prediction.",

We enable deconvolution of reads with Xenome, quantification of spatial gene expression from host and graft species with Space Ranger, extraction of B-allele frequencies, and splicing quantification with Velocyto. In the H&E image processing sub-workflow, we generate morphometric and deep learning-derived feature quantifications complementary to the Visium spots, enabling multi-modal H&E/expression comparisons. We have wrapped the pipeline into Nextflow DSL2 in a scalable, portable, and easy-to-use framework. <h4>Summary</h4> We designed a Nextflow DSL2-based pipeline, Spatial Transcriptomics Quantification (STQ), for simultaneous processing of 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics data and a matched hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide image (WSI), optimized for Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) cancer specimens. Our pipeline enables the classification of sequenced transcripts for deconvolving the mouse and human species and mapping the transcripts to reference transcriptomes. We align the H&E WSI with the spatial layout of the Visium slide and generate imaging and quantitative morphology features for each Visium spot. The pipeline design enables multiple analysis workflows, including single or dual reference genomes input and stand-alone image analysis. We showed the utility of our pipeline on a dataset from Visium profiling of four melanoma PDX samples. The clustering of Visium spots and clustering of imaging features of H&E data reveal similar patterns arising from the two data modalities.",

      "abstract": "There has been significant recent progress in leveraging large-scale gene expression data to develop foundation models for single-cell biology. Models such as Geneformer and scGPT implicitly learn gene and cellular functions from the gene expression profiles of millions of cells, which requires extensive data curation and resource-intensive training. Here we explore a much simpler alternative by leveraging ChatGPT embeddings of genes based on literature. Our proposal, GenePT, uses NCBI text descriptions of individual genes with GPT-3.5 to generate gene embeddings. From there, GenePT generates single-cell embeddings in two ways: (i) by averaging the gene embeddings, weighted by each gene’s expression level; or (ii) by creating a sentence embedding for each cell, using gene names ordered by the expression level. Without the need for dataset curation and additional pretraining, GenePT is efficient and easy to use. On many downstream tasks used to evaluate recent single-cell foundation models — e.g., classifying gene properties and cell types — GenePT achieves comparable, and often better, performance than Geneformer and other models. GenePT demonstrates that large language model embedding of literature is a simple and effective path for biological foundation models.",

      "title": "Deep Learning for Biomarker Discovery in Cancer Genomes",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Genomic data is essential for clinical decision-making in precision oncology. Bioinformatic algorithms are widely used to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, but they face two major challenges. First, these pipelines are highly complex, involving multiple steps and the integration of various tools. Second, they generate features that are human-interpretable but often result in information loss by focusing only on predefined genetic properties. This limitation restricts the full potential of NGS data in biomarker extraction and slows the discovery of new biomarkers in precision oncology. <h4>Methods</h4> We propose an end-to-end deep learning (DL) approach for analyzing NGS data. Specifically, we developed a multiple instance learning DL framework that integrates somatic mutation sequences to predict two compound biomarkers: microsatellite instability (MSI) and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). To achieve this, we utilized data from 3,184 cancer patients obtained from two public databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteome Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). <h4>Results</h4> Our proposed deep learning method demonstrated high accuracy in identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. For predicting MSI status, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.98, a sensitivity of 0.95, and a specificity of 1.00 on an external validation cohort. For predicting HRD status, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.75, and a specificity of 0.86. Furthermore, the deep learning approach significantly outperformed traditional machine learning methods in both tasks (MSI accuracy, p-value = 5.11×10 −18 ; HRD accuracy, p-value = 1.07×10 −10 ). Using explainability techniques, we demonstrated that the model’s predictions are based on biologically meaningful features, aligning with key DNA damage repair mutation signatures. <h4>Conclusion</h4> We demonstrate that deep learning can identify patterns in unfiltered somatic mutations without the need for manual feature extraction. This approach enhances the detection of actionable targets and paves the way for developing NGS-based biomarkers using minimally processed data.",

      "abstract": "RNA is a dynamic biomolecule crucial for cellular regulation, with its function largely determined by its folding into complex structures, while misfolding can lead to multifaceted biological sequelae. During the folding process, RNA traverses through a series of intermediate structural states, with each transition occurring at variable rates that collectively influence the time required to reach the functional form. Understanding these folding kinetics is vital for predicting RNA behavior and optimizing applications in synthetic biology and drug discovery. While in silico kinetic RNA folding simulators are often computationally intensive and time-consuming, accurate approximations of the folding times can already be very informative to assess the efficiency of the folding process. In this work, we present KinPFN, a novel approach that leverages prior-data fitted networks to directly model the posterior predictive distribution of RNA folding times. By training on synthetic data representing arbitrary prior folding times, KinPFN efficiently approximates the cumulative distribution function of RNA folding times in a single forward pass, given only a few initial folding time examples. Our method offers a modular extension to existing RNA kinetics algorithms, promising significant computational speed-ups orders of magnitude faster, while achieving comparable results. We showcase the effectiveness of KinPFN through extensive evaluations and real-world case studies, demonstrating its potential for RNA folding kinetics analysis, its practical relevance, and generalization to other biological data.",

      "abstract": "Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data. To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation. Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%).

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Promoters are essential DNA sequences that initiate transcription and regulate gene expression. Precisely identifying promoter sites is crucial for deciphering gene expression patterns and the roles of gene regulatory networks. Recent advancements in bioinformatics have leveraged deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance promoter prediction accuracy. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and BERT models have been particularly impactful. However, current approaches often rely on arbitrary DNA sequence segmentation during BERT pre-training, which may not yield optimal results. To overcome this limitation, this article introduces a novel DNA sequence segmentation method. This approach develops a more refined dictionary for DNA sequences, utilizes it for BERT pre-training, and employs an Inception neural network as the foundational model. This BERT-Inception architecture captures information across multiple granularities. Experimental results show that the model improves the performance of several downstream tasks and introduces deep learning interpretability, providing new perspectives for interpreting and understanding DNA sequence information.

      "abstract": "Serous borderline tumors (SBT) are epithelial neoplastic lesions of the ovaries that commonly have a good prognosis. In 10-15% of cases, however, SBT will recur as low-grade serous cancer (LGSC), which is deeply invasive and responds poorly to current standard chemotherapy 1,2,3 . While genetic alterations suggest a common origin, the transition from SBT to LGSC remains poorly understood 4 . Here, we integrate spatial proteomics 5 with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the evolution from SBT to LGSC and its corresponding metastasis at the molecular level in both the stroma and the tumor. We show that the transition of SBT to LGSC occurs in the epithelial compartment through an intermediary stage with micropapillary features (SBT-MP), which involves a gradual increase in MAPK signaling. A distinct subset of proteins and transcripts was associated with the transition to invasive tumor growth, including the neuronal splicing factor NOVA2, which was limited to expression in LGSC and its corresponding metastasis. An integrative pathway analysis exposed aberrant molecular signaling of tumor cells supported by alterations in angiogenesis and inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Integration of spatial transcriptomics and proteomics followed by knockdown of the most altered genes or pharmaceutical inhibition of the most relevant targets confirmed their functional significance in regulating key features of invasiveness. Combining cell-type resolved spatial proteomics and transcriptomics allowed us to elucidate the sequence of tumorigenesis from SBT to LGSC. The approach presented here is a blueprint to systematically elucidate mechanisms of tumorigenesis and find novel treatment strategies.",

Uncovering the causes of intragenic heterogeneity of translation, especially in contexts of different amino acid deprivations, could help increase our understanding of these disorders and pave the way for novel therapeutics. Ribosome profiling provides accurate measurements for the genome-wide ribosome footprints, which could be utilized to investigate these mechanisms. Here we present Riboclette, a conditional deep learning model featuring a dual output head that uses the mRNA sequence input to accurately predict the ribosome footprint profiles across six amino acid deprivation conditions. Exploiting standard interpretability methods, we identify specific codons related to deprived amino acids, poly-basic regions, and negatively charged amino acids as the primary drivers of the stalling response. Moreover, we use Riboclette to extract motif level drivers for ribosome stalling by performing in silico perturbation experiments. The extracted motifs highlight the cumulative contribution of deprived codons in triggering ribosome stalling, which, depending on the condition, have been identified to affect translation up to ten codons downstream. Moreover, motifs precisely explain stalling at different codon positions, allowing for the differentiation between expected determinants of rare stalling events. Our framework offers an accurate and explainable method for understanding the effect of different amino acid deprivation conditions at a codon resolution to help elucidate the impact of intragenic variations on the regulation of translation elongation.",

However, three fundamental differences between single-cell data and natural language data are overlooked: (1) scRNA-seq data are presented as bag-of-genes instead of sequences of RNAs; (2) Cell-cell relations are more intricate and important than inter-sentence relations; and (3) The quantity of single-cell data is considerably inferior to text data, and they are very noisy. In light of these characteristics, we propose a new pre-trained model CellPLM , which takes cells as tokens and tissues as sentences. In addition, we leverage spatially-resolved transcriptomic data in pre-training to facilitate learning cell-cell relationships and introduce a Gaussian mixture prior distribution as an additional inductive bias to overcome data limitation. CellPLM is the first single-cell pre-trained transformer that encodes cell-cell relations and it consistently outperforms existing pre-trained and non-pre-trained models in diverse downstream tasks, with 100x times higher inference speed compared to existing pre-trained models.",

      "abstract": "Charting a biological atlas of an organ, such as the brain, requires us to spatially-resolve whole transcriptomes of single cells, and to relate such cellular features to the histological and anatomical scales. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq (sc/snRNA-seq) can map cells comprehensively 5,6 , but relating those to their histological and anatomical positions in the context of an organ’s common coordinate framework remains a major challenge and barrier to the construction of a cell atlas 7–10 . Conversely, Spatial Transcriptomics allows for in-situ measurements 11–13 at the histological level, but at lower spatial resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies 1–3 solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput which impedes profiling of the entire transcriptome. Finally, as samples are collected for profiling, their registration to anatomical atlases often require human supervision, which is a major obstacle to build pipelines at scale. Here, we demonstrate spatial mapping of cells, histology, and anatomy in the somatomotor area and the visual area of the healthy adult mouse brain. We devise Tangram, a method that aligns snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same brain region, including MERFISH 1 , STARmap 2 , smFISH 3 , and Spatial Transcriptomics 4 (Visium), as well as histological images and public atlases. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multi-modal data such as SHARE-seq data 5 , which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We equipped Tangram with a deep learning computer vision pipeline, which allows for automatic identification of anatomical annotations on histological images of mouse brain. By doing so, Tangram reconstructs a genome-wide, anatomically-integrated, spatial map of the visual and somatomotor area with ∼30,000 genes at single-cell resolution, revealing spatial gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterning beyond current limitation of in-situ technologies.",

      "title": "Representation learning of single-cell time-series with deep variational autoencoders",
      "abstract": "Single-cell technologies have led to many insights on the function of individual cells within populations. Time-series data, in particular, have become increasingly adopted to uncover the molecular basis of heterogeneity in processes such as gene regulation, growth adaptation, and drug resistance. Yet the analysis of single-cell trajectories often requires manual and application-dependent techniques to extract meaningful features that correlate with the biological processes of interest. Here, we employ representation learning to automatically encode time-series into a low-dimensional feature space that can be used for downstream prediction tasks. We trained deep variational autoencoders on cell length data from Escherichia coli cells growing in a “mother machine” device that allows tracking single cells over long periods. We show that the learned representations preserve the structure of the data across various growth media. Using the pretrained model in tandem with supervised learning, we encoded fresh time-series from cells exposed to single and combination antibiotics, which achieved excellent classification accuracy across drug treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings can be used to accurately classify datasets from different laboratories and growth conditions without retraining. This demonstrates that the autoencoder extracts meaningful information with promising generalization power. Our results highlight the potential of representation learning for the analysis of single-cell responses under chemical perturbations and growth conditions.",

      "title": "MiroSCOPE: An AI-driven digital pathology platform for annotating functional tissue units",
      "abstract": "Cancer tissue analysis in digital pathology is typically conducted across different spatial scales, ranging from high-resolution cell-level modeling to lower-resolution tile-based assessments. However, these perspectives often overlook the structural organization of functional tissue units (FTUs), the small, repeating structures which are crucial to tissue function and key factors during pathological assessment. The incorporation of FTU information is hindered by the need for detailed manual annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. While artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions hold great promise to accelerate this process, there is currently no comprehensive workflow for building the large, annotated cohorts required. To remove these roadblocks and advance the development of more interpretable approaches, we developed MiroSCOPE, an end-to-end AI-assisted platform for annotating FTUs at scale, built on QuPath. MiroSCOPE integrates a fine-tunable multiclass segmentation model and curation-specific usability features to enable a human-in-the-loop system that accelerates AI annotation by a pathologist. The system is used to efficiently annotate over 71,900 FTUs on 184 prostate cancer hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue samples and demonstrates ready translation to breast cancer. Furthermore, we publicly release a dataset named Miro-120, consisting of 120 prostate cancer H&E with 30,568 annotations, which can be used by the community as a high-quality resource for FTU-level machine learning aims. In summary, MiroSCOPE provides an adaptable AI-driven platform for annotating functional tissue units, facilitating the use of structural information in digital pathology analyses.",

      "title": "Predicting gene expression from histone marks using chromatin deep learning models depends on histone mark function, regulatory distance and cellular states",
      "abstract": "To understand the complex relationship between histone mark activity and gene expression, recent advances have used in silico predictions based on large-scale machine learning models. However, these approaches have omitted key contributing factors like cell state, histone mark function or distal effects, that impact the relationship, limiting their findings. Moreover, downstream use of these models for new biological insight is lacking. Here, we present the most comprehensive study of this relationship to date - investigating seven histone marks, in eleven cell types, across a diverse range of cell states. We used convolutional and attention-based models to predict transcription from histone mark activity at promoters and distal regulatory elements. Our work shows that histone mark function, genomic distance and cellular states collectively influence a histone mark’s relationship with transcription. We found that no individual histone mark is consistently the strongest predictor of gene expression across all genomic and cellular contexts. This highlights the need to consider all three factors when determining the effect of histone mark activity on transcriptional state. Furthermore, we conducted in silico histone mark perturbation assays, uncovering functional and disease related loci and highlighting frameworks for the use of chromatin deep learning models to uncover new biological insight. <h4>Graphical abstract</h4>",

We characterize the performance of BetaAlign and the effect of various aspects on accuracy; for example, the size of the training data, the effect of different transformer architectures, and the effect of learning on a subspace of indel-model parameters (subspace learning).

      "abstract": "The last three years have seen an explosion in published manuscripts analysing open-access health datasets, in many cases presenting misleading or biologically implausible findings. There is a growing evidence base to suggest that this is due in part to AI-assisted and formulaic workflows. Here we employ a top-down scientometric analysis to investigate which datasets have seen publication rates deviate from previous trends, especially where this coincides with changes to author geographical origins and increases in formulaic titles. Across 34 datasets we identify five showing hallmarks of paper mill exploitation (the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, NHANES, UK Biobank, FinnGen and the Global Burden of Disease Study). These five datasets had, in 2024, a combined publication count of 11,554 indexed in the PubMed database. This represents an excess of around five thousand publications above the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecast trend, and is a 2.8x fold change on the 4,001 publication count for these five datasets in 2021. We also identified a notable difference in the fold change for China (9.5x) versus the rest of the world (1.2x) and an increase in formulaic titles. These findings highlight potential risks to research integrity in areas such as public health and drug safety, and especially to the accessibility and interoperability principles central to Open Science and FAIR data practices. We argue that permissive open-access data policies naturally facilitate exploitative workflows, from direct API access for data dredging to large language model authoring of papers. These findings add to the case for the adoption of controlled data-access mechanisms combined with pre-registration of research protocols as safeguards, as previously used in the field of genomics, to reduce false discoveries and misleading conclusions. Such an approach would balance data availability with responsible use, preserving the goals of Open Science and mitigating against disincentives for compliance with the FAIR Guiding Principles.",

      "title": "Transformer Enables Reference Free And Unsupervised Analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics",
      "abstract": "The development of spatial transcriptomics technologies makes it possible to study tissue heterogeneity at the scale of spatial expressed microenvironment. However, most of the previous methods collapse the spatial patterns in the low spatial resolution. Existing reference based deconvolution methods integrate single-cell reference and spatial transcriptomics data to predict the proportion of cell-types, but the availability of suitable single-cell reference is often limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model (TransfromerST) to integrate the spatial gene expression measurements and their spatial patterns in the histology image (if available) without single cell reference. TransfromerST enables the learning of the locally realistic and globally consistent constituents at nearly single cell resolution. TransfromerST firstly uses a transformer based variational autoencoder to explore the latent representation of gene expression, which is further embedded with the spatial relationship learned from adaptive graph Transformer model. The super-resolved cross-scale graph network improves the model-fit to enhanced structure-functional interactions. The public and in-house experimental results with multimodal spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate TransfromerST could highlight the tissue structures at nearly single cell resolution and detect the spatial variable genes and meta gene for each spatial domain. In summary, TransfromerST provides an effective and efficient alternative for spatial transcriptomics tissue clustering, super-resolution and gene expression prediction from histology image.",

      "abstract": "Single-cell multimodal datasets have measured various characteristics of individual cells, enabling a deep understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms. However, multimodal data generation remains costly and challenging, and missing modalities happen frequently. Recently, machine learning approaches have been developed for data imputation but typically require fully matched multimodalities to learn common latent embeddings that potentially lack modality specificity. To address these issues, we developed an open-source machine learning model, Joint Variational Autoencoders for multimodal Imputation and Embedding (JAMIE). JAMIE takes single-cell multimodal data that can have partially matched samples across modalities. Variational autoencoders learn the latent embeddings of each modality. Then, embeddings from matched samples across modalities are aggregated to identify joint cross-modal latent embeddings before reconstruction. To perform cross-modal imputation, the latent embeddings of one modality can be used with the decoder of the other modality. For interpretability, Shapley values are used to prioritize input features for cross-modal imputation and known sample labels. We applied JAMIE to both simulation data and emerging single-cell multimodal data including gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and electrophysiology in human and mouse brains. JAMIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in general and prioritized multimodal features for imputation, providing potentially novel mechanistic insights at cellular resolution.",

Using data from UK Biobank, SAIL Biobank, and FinnGen, we conducted an unbiased, population-scale study to: 1) Investigate how 155 endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive system disorders are associated with AD and PD risk prior to their diagnosis, considering known genetic influences; 2) Assess plasma biomarkers’ specificity for AD or PD in individuals with these conditions; 3) Develop a multi-modal classification model integrating genetics, proteomics, and clinical data relevant to conditions affecting the gut-brain axis. Our findings show that certain disorders elevate AD and PD risk before AD and PD diagnosis including: insulin and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, noninfective gastro-enteritis and colitis, functional intestinal disorders, and bacterial intestinal infections, among others. Polygenic risk scores revealed lower genetic predisposition to AD and PD in individuals with co-occurring disorders in the study categories, underscoring the importance of regulating the gut-brain axis to potentially prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. The proteomic profile of AD/PD cases was influenced by comorbid endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive systems conditions. Importantly, we developed multi-modal prediction models integrating clinical, genetic, proteomic and demographic data, the combination of which performs better than any single paradigm approach in disease classification. This work aims to illuminate the intricate interplay between various physiological factors involved in the gut-brain axis and the development of AD and PD, providing a multifactorial systemic understanding that goes beyond traditional approaches.

A challenge in studying these processes using single-cell genomics is that the data provides only a static snapshot with no detail of dynamics. Metabolic labelling and splicing can provide time-resolved information, but current methods have limitations. Here, we present experimental and computational methods that overcome these limitations to allow dynamical modelling of gene expression from single-cell data. We developed sci-FATE2, an optimised metabolic labelling method that substantially increases data quality, and profiled approximately 45,000 embryonic stem cells differentiating into multiple neural tube identities. To recover dynamics, we developed velvet, a deep learning framework that extends beyond instantaneous velocity estimation by modelling gene expression dynamics through a neural stochastic differential equation system within a variational autoencoder. Velvet outperforms current velocity tools across quantitative benchmarks, and predicts trajectory distributions that accurately recapitulate underlying dataset distributions while conserving known biology. Velvet trajectory distributions capture dynamical aspects such as decision boundaries between alternative fates and correlative gene regulatory structure. Using velvet to provide a dynamical description of in vitro neural patterning, we highlight a process of sequential decision making and fate-specific patterns of developmental signalling. Together, these experimental and computational methods recast single-cell analyses from descriptions of observed data distributions to models of the dynamics that generated them, providing a new framework for investigating developmental gene regulation and cell fate decisions.",

This vision-based multiscale cell map defines cellular subsystems with high resolution of protein complexes, reveals proteins with similar functions, and distinguishes dynamic and stable behaviors within cellular compartments. Finally, Subcell enables a rich multimodal protein representation when integrated with a protein sequence model, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of gene function than either vision-only or sequence-only models alone. In conclusion, SubCell creates deep, image-driven representations of cellular architecture that are applicable across diverse biological contexts and datasets.",

      "abstract": "Multi-omics data provide a comprehensive view of gene regulation at multiple levels, which is helpful in achieving accurate diagnosis of complex diseases like cancer. To integrate various multi-omics data of tissue and liquid biopsies for disease diagnosis and prognosis, we developed a biological pathway informed Transformer, Pathformer. It embeds multi-omics input with a compacted multi-modal vector and a pathway-based sparse neural network. Pathformer also leverages criss-cross attention mechanism to capture the crosstalk between different pathways and modalities. We first benchmarked Pathformer with 18 comparable methods on multiple cancer datasets, where Pathformer outperformed all the other methods, with an average improvement of 6.3%-14.7% in F1 score for cancer survival prediction and 5.1%-12% for cancer stage prediction. Subsequently, for cancer prognosis prediction based on tissue multi-omics data, we used a case study to demonstrate the biological interpretability of Pathformer by identifying key pathways and their biological crosstalk. Then, for cancer early diagnosis based on liquid biopsy data, we used plasma and platelet datasets to demonstrate Pathformer’s potential of clinical applications in cancer screen. Moreover, we revealed deregulation of interesting pathways (e.g., scavenger receptor pathway) and their crosstalk in cancer patients’ blood, providing new candidate targets for cancer microenvironment study.",

We created GARNET (Gtdb Acquired RNa with Environmental Temperatures), a new database for RNA structural and functional analysis anchored to the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) 5 . GARNET links RNA sequences derived from GTDB genomes to experimental and predicted optimal growth temperatures of GTDB reference organisms. This enables construction of deep and diverse RNA sequence alignments to be used for machine learning. Using GARNET, we define the minimal requirements for a sequence- and structure-aware RNA generative model. We also develop a GPT-like language model for RNA in which overlapping triplet tokenization provides optimal encoding. Leveraging hyperthermophilic RNAs in GARNET and these RNA generative models, we identified mutations in ribosomal RNA that confer increased thermostability to the Escherichia coli ribosome.

      "abstract": "Arterial aging, marked by progressive vascular stiffening, is a contributor to cardiovascular disease. Photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms offer an easily accessible signal of arterial function, enabling scalable assessment of arterial age at the population level. Here, we present a multimodal deep learning framework integrating raw PPG waveforms with hemodynamic features from UK Biobank participants to construct an arterial aging clock. From this model, we derived  ArtAgeGap , an age-independent residual biomarker of arterial aging, which correlated with established measures of vascular stiffening, such as pulse pressure (  r =0.60).  ArtAgeGap was significantly elevated in individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, and associated with diabetes (+0.93 years, 95%CI: 0.64-1.21) and hyperlipidemia (+0.49, [0.36-0.61]). In 96,615 participants followed for a median of 13 years, higher  ArtAgeGap values predicted incident hypertension, major adverse cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (hazard ratios per +1 year: 1.01-1.06), on top of chronological age. A genome-wide association study in 114,098 individuals identified 60 independent loci associated with  ArtAgeGap , including variants previously associated with blood pressure (e.g.  NPR3 ), arterial stiffness (  CLCN6 ), aortic diameter (  SLC24A3 ), and atherosclerosis (  HDAC 9), as well as 34 novel loci enriched for arterial tissue expression. Integrative analyses with transcriptomic data from human arteries prioritized 28 genes, such as  RSG19 and  ULK4 , whose genetically proxied expression was associated with  ArtAgeGap . Single-cell transcriptomic data from arterial tissue revealed strong enrichment of these genes in fibroblasts, implicating fibrotic remodeling mechanisms in arterial aging. Rare variant burden testing further implicated damaging variants in  COL21A1 ,  LMNA ,  TP53BP2 ,  RXRB , and  FLOT2 , also converging to mechanisms related to extracellular matrix organization and fibrosis regulation. Lastly, Mendelian randomization analysis identified  ArtAgeGap as an intermediate biomarker in-between vascular risk factors and outcomes, with central adiposity, higher blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes increasing  ArtAgeGap , and higher  ArtAgeGap elevating the risks of coronary heart disease and stroke. Together, these findings establish  ArtAgeGap as a scalable PPG-based biomarker of arterial aging and provide mechanistic insights into potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate arterial aging.",

      "abstract": "Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is increasingly being used in computational biology to support code generation for data analysis. In this study, we evaluated the ability of LLMs to generate functional R and Python code for predictive modeling tasks, leveraging standardized molecular datasets from several recent DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) Challenges focused on reproductive health. We assessed LLM performance across four predictive tasks derived from three DREAM challenges: gestational age regression from gene expression, gestational age regression from DNA methylation profiles, and classification of preterm birth and early preterm birth from microbiome data. LLMs were prompted with task descriptions, data locations, and target outcomes. LLM-generated code was then run to fit and apply prediction models and generate graphics, and they were ranked based on their success in completing the tasks and achieving strong test set performance. Among the eight LLMs tested, o3-mini-high, 4o, DeepseekR1 and Gemini 2.0 completed at least one task without error. Overall, R code generation was more successful (14/16 tasks) than Python (7/16), attributed to the utility of Bioconductor packages for querying Gene Expression Omnibus data. OpenAI’s o3-mini-high outperformed others, completing 7/8 tasks. Test set performance of the top LLM matched or exceeded top-performing teams from the original DREAM challenges. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance exploratory analysis and democratize access to predictive modeling in omics by automating key components of analysis pipelines, and highlight the potential to increase research output when conducting analyses of standardized datasets from public repositories.",

This model combines the two modalities according to the connection between the latent variables of different modalities calculated by attention-like mechanisms and achieves cross-modal predictions and an inverse analysis. We discovered that the predicted electrophysiological features changed continuously along with their transcriptional profiles and that the neighborhood relationships between the latent states of the transcriptional profiles were consistent with those of the electrophysiological features. Inverse analysis of our model enabled the extraction of gene sets affecting specific time-frequency domains; some genes were likely to be involved in neural activity. Our approach represents a potential avenue to facilitate the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying time-frequency activities in various cell types, enhancing our understanding of their roles in neural function.",

As all currently published models in this class employ vastly different pre-training strategies, it is impossible to determine which practices drive their success (or failure). Here, we present a large-scale study of pre-training components for single-cell transcriptomic transformers: bento-sc (BENchmarking Transformer-Obtained Single-Cell representations). By isolating (and tuning) parts of the pre-training scheme one by one, we define best practices for single-cell language model (scLM) construction. While comparisons with baselines indicate that scLMs do not yet offer the generational leap in prediction performances promised by many foundation models, we identify key design choices leading to their improved performance. Namely, the best scLMs are obtained by: (1) minimally processing counts at the input level, (2) using reconstruction losses that exploit known count distributions, (3) masking (up to high rates), and (4) combining different pre-training tasks/losses.

      "abstract": "High-throughput \"omics\" data, including genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data, have become increasingly produced and have contributed in recent years to the advances in cancer research. In particular, multimodal omics data get now employed in addition to clinical data to stratify patients according to their clinical outcomes. Despite some recent work on benchmarking multi-modal integration strategies for cancer survival prediction, there is still a need for the standardization of the results of model performances and for the consecutive exploration of the relative performance of statistical and deep learning models. Here, we propose a unique benchmark, SurvBoard, which standardizes several important experimental design choices to enable comparability between cancer survival models that incorporate multi-omics data. By designing several benchmarking scenarios, SurvBoard allows for the comparison of single-cancer models and models trained on pan-cancer data; SurvBoard also makes it possible to investigate the added value of using patient data with missing modalities. Additionally, in this work, we point out several potential pitfalls that might arise during the preprocessing and validation of multi-omics cancer survival models and address them in our benchmark. We compare statistical and deep learning models revealing that statistical models often outperform deep learning models, particularly in terms of model calibration. Finally, we offer a web service that enables quick model evaluation against our benchmark (https://www.survboard.science/).

      "title": "Translating Brain Anatomy and Disease from Mouse to Human in Latent Gene Expression Space",
      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4>  <h4>Background</h4>  The mouse model is the most widely used animal model in neuroscience, yet translating findings to humans suffers from the lack of formal models comparing the mouse and the human brain. Here, we devised a novel framework using mouse and human gene expression to build a quantitative common space and apply it to models of neurodegenerative disease. <h4>Methods</h4>  We trained a variational autoencoder on mouse spatial transcriptomics, and embedded mouse and human gene orthologs in the model’s latent space. We computed a latent cross-species similarity matrix for translation and compared translated maps to human ground truth evidence. <h4>Findings</h4>  We established the validity of our model based on anatomical homology. Independent of species, brain areas with similar latent patterns clustered together, improving the homology of known anatomical pairs, and preserving principles of brain organisation. Importantly, brain alterations in mouse disease models predicted human patterns of brain changes in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. We further determined the best mouse model for the AD patients, based on how well the translations matched the patient data, across multiple models and timepoints. <h4>Interpretation</h4>  Our work provides i) a quantitative bridge across evolutionary divergence between the human and the predominant preclinical species, ii) a predictive framework to help design and evaluate disease models. By highlighting which models are best suited across stages of disease, we effectively support the understanding of disease mechanisms, assist in the workflow of clinical trials, and ultimately accelerate the transformation of findings into improved human outcomes. <h4>Funding</h4>  Supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Coundil (BBSRC) UK, the Medical Research Council (MRC) UK, the European Research Council, and the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre. <h4>Research in Context</h4>  <h4>Evidence before this study</h4>  Inferences on the human brain based on findings in the mouse are backed by broad neuroanatomical similarities between the two species. However, interventions that were successful in rodents rarely translate into successful outcomes to treat human diseases. One way to address this challenge is to quantify the boundaries of translational possibilities using cross-species common space approaches. Low-level embedding spaces have been used to quantitatively compare across species, but there is currently no framework for effective translation of disease maps between species, and no tool to establish the best animal model for a given patient population. <h4>Added value of this study</h4>  This study is the first to quantitatively link mouse models of neurodegenerative disease with human patient data. After validating our novel VAE-based comparative framework on anatomical homology compared to existing methods, we determine which of three Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) mouse models, and at which timepoint, best models a human patient population with mild AD. In addition, we predicted human brain changes in human Parkinson’s Disease, based on maps from mouse models of this disease. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4>  This approach allows one to directly evaluate mouse models based on the quality of their translation to the human. At the level of preclinical model design, the translation from human to mouse of diverse disease phenotypes will highlight the relevant targets for intervention in the mouse. This will justify the relevance of specific animal models and time courses, and therefore streamline clinical trials. By additionally translating the effect of treatment or intervention longitudinally, we can optimize human treatment plans and life-long disease management. Combined with patient population stratification, this takes an important step towards personalised translational medicine.",

      "abstract": "Rare variant association analysis, which assesses the aggregate effect of rare damaging variants within a gene, is a powerful strategy for advancing knowledge of human biology. Numerous models have been proposed to identify damaging coding variants, with the most recent ones employing deep learning and large language models (LLM) to predict the impact of changes in coding sequences. Here, we use newly available proteomics data on 2,898 proteins across 46, 665 individuals to evaluate and refine LLM predictors of damaging variants. Using one of these refined models, we evaluate association between rare damaging variants and human phenotypes at 241 positive control gene-trait pairs. Among these gene-trait pairs, our proteomics-guided model outperforms an ensemble of conventional approaches including PolyPhen2, Mutation Taster, SIFT, and LRT, as well as newer machine learning approaches for identifying damaging missense variants, such as CADD, ESM-1v, ESM-1b and AlphaMissense. When attempting to recover known associations by correctly separating damaging singleton missense variants from other singleton variants, our approach recapitulates 36.5% of gene-trait pairs with known associations, exceeding all the alternatives we considered. Furthermore, when we apply our model to 10 exemplary traits from the UK Biobank, we identify 177 gene-trait associations – again exceeding all other approaches. Our results demonstrate that summary statistics from large-scale human proteomics data enable evaluation and refinement of coding variant classification LLMs, improving discovery potential in human genetic studies.",

      "title": "Text mining biomedical literature to identify extremely unbalanced data for digital epidemiology and systematic reviews: dataset and methods for a SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology study",
      "abstract": "There are many studies that require researchers to extract specific information from the published literature, such as details about sequence records or about a randomized control trial. While manual extraction is cost efficient for small studies, larger studies such as systematic reviews are much more costly and time-consuming. To avoid exhaustive manual searches and extraction, and their related cost and effort, natural language processing (NLP) methods can be tailored for the more subtle extraction and decision tasks that typically only humans have performed. The need for such studies that use the published literature as a data source became even more evident as the COVID-19 pandemic raged through the world and millions of sequenced samples were deposited in public repositories such as GI-SAID and GenBank, promising large genomic epidemiology studies, but more often than not lacked many important details that prevented large-scale studies. Thus, granular geographic location or the most basic patient-relevant data such as demographic information, or clinical outcomes were not noted in the sequence record. However, some of these data was indeed published, but in the text, tables, or supplementary material of a corresponding published article. We present here methods to identify relevant journal articles that report having produced and made available in GenBank or GISAID, new SARS-CoV-2 sequences, as those that initially produced and made available the sequences are the most likely articles to include the high-level details about the patients from whom the sequences were obtained. Human annotators validated the approach, creating a gold standard set for training and validation of a machine learning classifier. Identifying these articles is a crucial step to enable future automated informatics pipelines that will apply Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to identify patient characteristics such as co-morbidities, outcomes, age, gender, and race, enriching SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases with actionable information for defining large genomic epidemiology studies. Thus, enriched patient metadata can enable secondary data analysis, at scale, to uncover associations between the viral genome (including variants of concern and their sublineages), transmission risk, and health outcomes. However, for such enrichment to happen, the right papers need to be found and very detailed data needs to be extracted from them. Further, finding the very specific articles needed for inclusion is a task that also facilitates scoping and systematic reviews, greatly reducing the time needed for full-text analysis and extraction.",

This has led to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes in African populations and overall scarcity of relevant pharmacogenetic data, including characteristic genotypes as well as drugs prescribed in the continent to treat infectious diseases. Here, we propose a general approach to identify drug-gene pairs with potential pharmacogenetic interest. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the analysis of malaria and tuberculosis therapies, many of which remain uncharacterised from a pharmacogenetic perspective. Our pipeline leverages artificial intelligence and the latest advances in knowledge embedding techniques to exploit currently available biomedical data and subsequently prioritise pharmacogenes for each drug. Predicted pharmacogenes are then incorporated into pharmacometric modelling to hypothesise which ones might be of clinical interest, and which dose adjustments could be made to provide better treatment outcomes for the African population.",

However, its variable-length tokens often span multiple nucleotides, limiting the model’s sensitivity to single-nucleotide variations—an essential requirement for accurate Variant Effect Prediction (VEP). We introduce Mut-BPE, a training-free, plug-and-play tokenization strategy that augments BPE with explicit single-nucleotide resolution at variant sites. Mut-BPE preserves the efficiency of BPE while enhancing its ability to represent subtle genomic alterations. To evaluate its effectiveness, we applied Mut-BPE to DNABERT-2 and conducted extensive experiments across six diverse datasets spanning gene expression, pathogenicity, and trait-associated variants, under zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Mut-BPE consistently outperformed conventional BPE tokenization, yielding significant improvements in both AUROC and AUPRC, particularly in imbalanced datasets. These results highlight Mut-BPE as a practical enhancement for genomic foundation models in VEP tasks. Code availability:  https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Mut-BPE-1182",

      "title": "Deep Learning in Spatial Transcriptomics: Learning From the Next Next-Generation Sequencing",
      "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies are rapidly becoming the extension of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), holding the potential of profiling gene expression at a single-cell resolution while maintaining cellular compositions within a tissue. Having both expression profiles and tissue organization enables researchers to better understand cellular interactions and heterogeneity, providing insight into complex biological processes that would not be possible with traditional sequencing technologies. The data generated by ST technologies are inherently noisy, high-dimensional, sparse, and multi-modal (including histological images, count matrices, etc.), thus requiring specialized computational tools for accurate and robust analysis. However, many ST studies currently utilize traditional scRNAseq tools, which are inadequate for analyzing complex ST datasets. On the other hand, many of the existing ST-specific methods are built upon traditional statistical or machine learning frameworks, which have shown to be sub-optimal in many applications due to the scale, multi-modality, and limitations of spatially-resolved data (such as spatial resolution, sensitivity and gene coverage). Given these intricacies, researchers have developed deep learning (DL)-based models to alleviate ST-specific challenges. These methods include new state-of-the-art models in alignment, spatial reconstruction, and spatial clustering among others. However, deep-learning models for ST analysis are nascent and remain largely underexplored. In this review, we provide an overview of existing state-of-the-art tools for analyzing spatially-resolved transcriptomics, while delving deeper into the DL-based approaches. We discuss the new frontiers and the open questions in this field and highlight the domains in which we anticipate transformational DL applications.",

      "abstract": "The ability to measure gene expression at single-cell resolution has elevated our understanding of how biological features emerge from complex and interdependent networks at molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. As technologies have evolved that complement scRNAseq measurements with things like single-cell proteomic, epigenomic, and genomic information, it becomes increasingly apparent how much biology exists as a product of multimodal regulation. Biological processes such as transcription, translation, and post-translational or epigenetic modification impose both energetic and specific molecular demands on a cell and are therefore implicitly constrained by the metabolic state of the cell. While metabolomics is crucial for defining a holistic model of any biological process, the chemical heterogeneity of the metabolome makes it particularly difficult to measure, and technologies capable of doing this at single-cell resolution are far behind other multiomics modalities. To address these challenges, we present GEFMAP (Gene Expression-based Flux Mapping and Metabolic Pathway Prediction), a method based on geometric deep learning for predicting flux through reactions in a global metabolic network using transcriptomics data, which we ultimately apply to scRNAseq. GEFMAP leverages the natural graph structure of metabolic networks to learn both a biological objective for each cell and estimate a mass-balanced relative flux rate for each reaction in each cell using novel deep learning models.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4> Transformer models are revolutionizing sequence analysis across various domains, from natural language processing to genomics. These models rely on tokenizers to split input sequences into manageable chunks — a straightforward task in natural language but more challenging for long DNA sequences that lack distinct “words.” Most biological tokenizers are data-driven and do not align with the “central dogma of molecular biology”: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins, with each three-letter codon specifying a particular amino acid, some of which are synonymous for the amino acids they represent. Start codons signal the beginning of protein synthesis, while stop codons signal its termination. The Genomic Tokenizer (GT) incorporates this biological process flow into a standard tokenizer interface within the HuggingFace transformer package. GT can be used to pre-train foundational transformer models on DNA sequences. We compare the performance of GT with two alternate tokenization strategies and discuss its potential applications. <h4>Availability and implementation</h4> The source code of GT is available from https://github.com/dermatologist/genomic-tokenizer under the MPL-2.0 license. It can be installed from Python Package Index (PyPI) and used as a tokenizer in transformer model training pipelines.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the spatial heterogeneity of tumors and its links to disease is a cornerstone of cancer biology. Emerging spatial technologies offer unprecedented capabilities towards this goal, but several limitations hinder their clinical adoption. To date, histopathology workflows still heavily depend on hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and serial immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, a cumbersome and tissue-exhaustive process that yields unaligned tissue images. We propose the VirtualMultiplexer, a generative AI toolkit that translates real H&E images to matching IHC images for several markers based on contrastive learning. The VirtualMultiplexer learns from unpaired H&E and IHC images and introduces a novel multi-scale loss to ensure consistent and biologically reliable stainings. The virtually multiplexed images enabled training a Graph Transformer that simultaneously learns from the joint spatial distribution of several markers to predict clinically relevant endpoints. Our results indicate that the VirtualMultiplexer achieves rapid, robust and precise generation of virtually multiplexed imaging datasets of high staining quality that are indistinguishable from the real ones. We successfully employed transfer learning to generate realistic virtual stainings across tissue scales, patient cohorts, and cancer types with no need for model fine-tuning. Crucially, the generated images are not only realistic but also clinically relevant, as they greatly improved the prediction of different clinical endpoints across patient cohorts and cancer types, speeding up histopathology workflows and accelerating spatial biology.",

      "abstract": "B cell selection and evolution play crucial roles in dictating successful immune responses. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies and deep-learning strategies have paved the way for generating and exploiting an ever-growing wealth of antibody repertoire data. The self-supervised nature of protein language models (PLMs) has demonstrated the ability to learn complex representations of antibody sequences and has been leveraged for a wide range of applications including diagnostics, structural modeling, and antigen-specificity predictions. PLM-derived likelihoods have been used to improve antibody affinities in vitro, raising the question of whether PLMs can capture and predict features of B cell selection in vivo. Here, we explore how general and antibody-specific PLM-generated sequence pseudolikelihoods (SPs) relate to features of in vivo B cell selection such as expansion, isotype usage, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) at single-cell resolution. Our results demonstrate that the type of PLM and the region of the antibody input sequence significantly affect the generated SP. Contrary to previous in vitro reports, we observe a negative correlation between SPs and binding affinity, whereas repertoire features such as SHM and isotype usage were strongly correlated with SPs. By constructing evolutionary lineage trees of B cell clones from human and mouse repertoires, we observe that SHMs are routinely among the most likely mutations suggested by PLMs and that mutating residues have lower absolute likelihoods than conserved residues. Our findings highlight the potential of PLMs to predict features of antibody selection and further suggest their potential to assist in antibody discovery and engineering. <h4>Key points</h4>  – In contrast to previous in vitro work (Hie et al., 2024), we observe a negative correlation between PLM-generated SP and binding affinity. This contrast can be explained by the inherent antibody germline bias posed by PLM training data and the difference between in vivo and in vitro settings. – Our findings also reveal a considerable correlation between SPs and repertoire features such as the V-gene family, isotype, and the amount of SHM. Moreover, labeled antigen-binding data suggested that SP is consistent with antigen-specificity and binding affinity. – By reconstructing B cell lineage evolutionary trajectories, we detected predictable features of SHM using PLMs. We observe that SHMs are routinely among the most likely mutations suggested by PLMs and that mutating residues have lower absolute likelihoods than conserved residues. – We demonstrate that the region of antibody sequence (CDR3 or full V(D)J) provided as input to the model, as well as the type of PLM used, influence the resulting SPs.",

The existing tools employ TF-DNA binding profiles from in vitro high-throughput technologies to predict TF-DNA binding affinity. However, TFs tend to bind to sequences in open chromatin regions in vivo , such TF binding preference is seldomly considered by these existing tools. In this study, we developed TRAFICA, an open chromatin language model to predict TF-DNA binding affinity by integrating the characteristics of sequences from open chromatin regions in ATAC-seq experiments and in vitro TF-DNA binding profiles from high-throughput technologies. We applied self-supervised learning to pre-train TRAFICA on over 13 million nucleotide sequences from the peaks in ATAC-seq experiments to learn the TF binding preference in vivo . TRAFICA was further fine-tuned using the TF-DNA binding profiles from PBM and HT-SELEX technologies to learn the association between TFs and their target DNA sequences. We observed that TRAFICA significantly outperformed both machine learning-based and deep learning-based tools in predicting in vitro and in vivo TF-DNA binding affinity. These findings indicate that considering the characteristics of sequences from open chromatin regions could significantly improve TF-DNA binding affinity prediction, particularly when limited TF-DNA binding profiles from high-throughput technologies are available for specific TFs.",

      "abstract": "Characterizing cancer poses a delicate challenge as it involves deciphering complex biological interactions within the tumor's microenvironment. Histology images and molecular profiling of tumors are often available in clinical trials and can be leveraged to understand these interactions. However, despite recent advances in representing multimodal data for weakly supervised tasks in the medical domain, numerous challenges persist in achieving a coherent and interpretable fusion of whole slide images and multi-omics data. Each modality operates at distinct biological levels, introducing substantial correlations both between and within data sources. In response to these challenges, we propose a deep-learning-based approach designed to represent multimodal data for precision medicine in a readily interpretable manner. Demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple test cases, our approach not only provides robust results but also extracts various scores, shedding light on the activity of each modality and their interactions at the pathway and gene levels. The strengths of our method lie in its capacity to unravel pathway activation through multimodal relationships and extend enrichment analysis to spatial data for supervised tasks. We showcase the efficiency and robustness of its interpretations of our method through an extensive exploration of multiple TCGA datasets and validation cohorts, underscoring its value in advancing our understanding of cancer.

Existing experimental and computational methods suffer from limitations in throughput, accuracy, and contextual relevance. Here, we introduce Ubicon, a deep learning framework designed to overcome these hurdles for accurate, proteome-wide human ESI prediction. Ubicon achieves high fidelity by synergistically integrating multimodal features: sequence embeddings from a protein language model specifically adapted for ESI prediction via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), predicted 3D structures, and subcellular localization context. Validated extensively, Ubicon achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC = 0.9305, AUPRC = 0.6812), significantly surpassing previous approaches. Applying Ubicon, we constructed a high-resolution map of the human E3-substrate interactome, revealing its systems-level architecture characterized by hub proteins and functional modules linked to distinct biological processes. Integrating predictions with cancer genomics further uncovered disease-specific ESI network rewiring, involving oncogenic ligases like AURKA and CDC20, linked to poor prognosis. Ubicon provides a powerful platform to dissect ubiquitin signaling, uncover disease mechanisms, and inform targeted protein degrader development.",

At the same time, variations in sample processing and experimental protocols introduce technical variability – or “batch effects” – in the molecular readouts, hindering comparative analyses across samples and individuals. Although batch effect correction methods are routinely applied in single-cell omics analyses, data integration often leads to overcorrection, resulting in the loss of true biological variability. In this study, we present STACAS v2, a semi-supervised scRNA-seq data integration method that leverages prior knowledge in the form of cell type annotations to preserve biological variance. Through an open and reproducible benchmarking pipeline, we show that semi-supervised STACAS outperforms popular unsupervised methods such as Harmony, FastMNN, Seurat v4, scVI, and Scanorama, as well as supervised methods such as scANVI and scGen. Notably, STACAS is robust to incomplete and imprecise cell type annotations, which are commonly encountered in real-life integration tasks. Highlighting its scalability, we successfully applied semi-supervised STACAS to construct a high-resolution map of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells encompassing over 500,000 cells from 265 individuals. Based on our findings, we argue that the incorporation of prior cell type information should be a common practice in single-cell data integration, and we provide a flexible framework for semi-supervised batch effect correction. STACAS seamlessly integrates with Seurat pipelines and can be run with one command: Run.STACAS(seurat.list, cell.labels).",

      "abstract": "Most human tissue collected in clinic for diagnosis of pathology is formalin fixed and paraffin embedded or snap frozen, both of which destroy ultrastructure, making them unsuitable for clinical research requiring high resolution imaging. For diagnosis of some pathologies, most commonly renal and ciliopathies, a portion of the tissue is preserved optimally for ultrastructural imaging using electron microscopy (EM), but molecular antigenicity is masked. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose a protocol for fixation of human tissue in the clinic in EM-grade formaldehyde in phosphate buffer, which stabilises tissue for at least a year and preserves both ultrastructure and molecular antigenicity. To leverage this tissue for clinical research, we developed a new ‘nanopathology’ pipeline and applied it to study intravascular immune cells in kidney biopsies from patients with a transplant. In contrast to routine diagnostic practice, which images only a few percent of the whole biopsy in 2D, the nanopathology pipeline images the microstructure of the entire biopsy with X-rays using high throughput tomography (HiTT), assigns identity to immune cells using non-permeabilisation immunolabelling and confocal fluorescence microscopy of 60 µm-thick slices in regions of interest (ROIs; glomeruli and peritubular capillaries), and then images those ROIs using volume EM, specifically serial block face scanning EM. Multimodal registration of all imaging datasets into the same virtual 3D space enables extraction of nanoscale features from patient tissue that had previously only been observed in in vitro or animal models. The established nanopathology pipeline could be optimised for application to clinical research investigating a range of pathologies in the future, and with sufficient speed-up could also find application in next generation diagnostic pathways.",

The rate of protein synthesis depends on the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) of the mRNAs, and recently, deep learning models were proposed to predict the translation output of mRNAs from the 5’UTR sequence. At the same time, large data sets of endogenous and reporter mRNA translation have become available. <h4>Results</h4> In this study we use complementary data obtained in two different cell types to assess the accuracy and generality of currently available models of translation. We find that while performing well on the data sets on which they were trained, deep learning models do not generalize well to other data sets, in particular of endogenous mRNAs, which differ in many properties from reporter constructs. <h4>Conclusions</h4> These differences limit the ability of deep learning models to uncover mechanisms of translation control and to predict the impact of genetic variation.

By constructing a spatial cellular graph with immunohistology images and gene expression as node attributes, xSiGra employs hybrid graph transformer models to delineate spatial cell types. Additionally, xSiGra integrates a novel variant of Grad-CAM component to uncover interpretable features, including pivotal genes and cells for various cell types, thereby facilitating deeper biological insights from spatial data. Through rigorous benchmarking against existing methods, xSiGra demonstrates superior performance across diverse spatial imaging datasets. Application of xSiGra on a lung tumor slice unveils the importance score of cells, illustrating that cellular activity is not solely determined by itself but also impacted by neighboring cells. Moreover, leveraging the identified interpretable genes, xSiGra reveals endothelial cell subset interacting with tumor cells, indicating its heterogeneous underlying mechanisms within the complex cellular communications.",

      "abstract": "Coronary microvascular disease (CMVD) is an underdiagnosed but significant contributor to the burden of ischemic heart disease, characterized by angina and myocardial infarction. The development of risk prediction models such as polygenic risk scores (PRS) for CMVD has been limited by a lack of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, there is significant overlap between CMVD and enrollment criteria for coronary artery disease (CAD) GWAS. In this study, we developed CMVD PRS models by selecting variants identified in a CMVD GWAS and applying weights from an external CAD GWAS, using CMVD-associated loci as proxies for the genetic risk. We integrated plasma proteomics, clinical measures from perfusion PET imaging, and PRS to evaluate their contributions to CMVD risk prediction in comprehensive machine and deep learning models. We then developed a novel unsupervised endotyping framework for CMVD from perfusion PET-derived myocardial blood flow data, revealing distinct patient subgroups beyond traditional case-control definitions. This imaging-based stratification substantially improved classification performance alongside plasma proteomics and PRS, achieving AUROCs between 0.65 and 0.73 per class, significantly outperforming binary classifiers and existing clinical models, highlighting the potential of this stratification approach to enable more precise and personalized diagnosis by capturing the underlying heterogeneity of CMVD. This work represents the first application of imaging-based endotyping and the integration of genetic and proteomic data for CMVD risk prediction, establishing a framework for multimodal modeling in complex diseases.",

However, the inherent heterogeneity and varying spatial resolutions present challenges in the joint analysis of multi-modal SRT data. We introduce a multi-modal geometric deep learning method, named stMMR, to effectively integrate gene expression, spatial location and histological information for accurate identifying spatial domains from SRT data. stMMR uses graph convolutional networks (GCN) and self-attention module for deep embedding of features within unimodal and incorporates similarity contrastive learning for integrating features across modalities. Comprehensive benchmark analysis on various types of spatial data shows superior performance of stMMR in multiple analyses, including spatial domain identification, pseudo-spatiotemporal analysis, and domain-specific gene discovery. In chicken heart development, stMMR reconstruct the spatiotemporal lineage structures indicating accurate developmental sequence. In breast cancer and lung cancer, stMMR clearly delineated the tumor microenvironment and identified marker genes associated with diagnosis and prognosis.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Background and Purpose: Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women worldwide, with early and accurate diagnosis critical for patient survival. Radiogenomics integrates imaging phenotypes with genomic profiles, offering a pathway to precision diagnostics. However, existing classical machine learning models often struggle with the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of multimodal data, leading to issues in calibration and reproducibility. This study presents Q RadFusion, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to enhance breast cancer diagnosis by fusing mammography and genomics data. <h4>Methods:</h4> Q RadFusion was implemented on two publicly available datasets: CBIS-DDSM (2,600 curated mammography cases, TCIA) and TCGA-BRCA (1,000 genomic profiles, GDC). Imaging preprocessing included bias-field correction, segmentation, and harmonization, while genomic data underwent normalization and imputation. Feature selection was performed using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and features were mapped into a quantum Hilbert space using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC). For multimodal fusion, ResNet encoded mammography features, and a Transformer encoded genomic features. Patient-level and site-held-out splits were used for evaluation. <h4>Results:</h4> Q RadFusion achieved an AUC of 0.96 and accuracy of 94%, outperforming baselines including CNN-LSTM, ResNet + XGBoost, and multimodal Transformers. Ablation studies confirmed the contribution of quantum components, with optimal performance observed at circuit depth \\(\\:L=6\\), qubits \\(\\:Q=10\\), and QAOA layers \\(\\:p=3\\). The model also demonstrated improved calibration and ~ 80% fewer parameters compared to deep fusion networks. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Q RadFusion demonstrates that hybrid quantum–classical radiogenomic integration can deliver accurate, reproducible, and clinically meaningful diagnostic support for breast cancer, with strong potential for future clinical translation.</p>",

Identifying pathogenicity-related genes is crucial for disease-resistant breeding and phytoprotection. Conventional methods relying on differential expression analysis and statistical models face limitations in temporal dynamic modeling, interpretability, and small-sample adaptability. Results This study presents a Multimodal Temporal Transformer-based Gene Identification Model (MTTGIM),Intelligent mining of pathogenic genes driven by multi-dimensional histological data is realized. The innovations are 1.A joint characterization method incorporating gene-specific embedding and dynamic temporal coding is proposed to break through the limitation that traditional positional coding cannot distinguish the temporal expression patterns of different genes.2.Multimodal convolutional attention architecture captures the local outbreak patterns of gene expression and gene interactions affecting the regulatory network through parallel temporal convolutional branching and global multi-head attention branching, respectively. The AUC reaches 0.72 in performance evaluation, an 11% improvement over lstm.3. The two-way attribution algorithm based on attention weights and gradient integrals localizes causative genes, locating multiple identified causative genes (e.g., ), as well as multiple potential causative genes. Conclusion Based on MTTGIM we screened for multiple possible rice blast causal genes that could be verified by crisp knockdown. This study provides a new paradigm for intelligent mining of genes for complex diseases, and the related algorithm has been patented.</p>",

Quantitative characterization of this relationship, however, is challenging due to the vast combinatorial possibilities and dynamic interplay between genotype and phenotype landscapes. Integrating high-content genotyping approaches such as single-cell RNA sequencing and advanced learning methods such as language models offers an opportunity for dissecting this complex relationship. Here, we present a computational integrated genetics framework designed to analyze and interpret the high-dimensional landscape of genotypes and their associated phenotypes simultaneously. We applied this approach to develop a multimodal foundation model to explore the genotype-phenotype relationship manifold for human transcriptomics at the cellular level. Analyzing this joint manifold showed a refined resolution of cellular heterogeneity, enhanced precision in phenotype annotating, and uncovered potential cross-tissue biomarkers that are undetectable through conventional gene expression analysis alone. Moreover, our results revealed that the gene networks are characterized by scale-free patterns and show context-dependent gene-gene interactions, both of which result in significant variations in the topology of the gene network, particularly evident during aging. Finally, utilizing contextualized embeddings, we investigated gene polyfunctionality which illustrates the multifaceted roles that genes play in different biological processes, and demonstrated that for VWF gene in endothelial cells.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Transformer-based models have spurred interest in their use for biological sequence analysis. However, adapting models like BERT is challenging due to sequence length, often requiring truncation for proteomics and genomics tasks. Additionally, advanced tokenization and relative positional encoding techniques for long contexts in NLP are often not directly transferable to DNA/RNA sequences, which require nucleotide or character-level encodings for tasks such as 3D torsion angle prediction. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adaptive dual tokenization scheme for bioinformatics that utilizes both nucleotide-level (NUC) and efficient BPE tokenizations. Building on the dual tokenization, we introduce BiRNA-BERT, a 117M parameter Transformer encoder pretrained with our proposed tokenization on 28 billion nucleotides across 36 million coding and non-coding RNA sequences. The learned representation by BiRNA-BERT generalizes across a range of applications and achieves state-of-the-art results in long-sequence downstream tasks and achieves a performance comparable to 6× larger models in short-sequence tasks with 27×less pre-training compute. BiRNA-BERT can dynamically adjust its tokenization strategy based on sequence lengths, utilizing NUC for shorter sequences and switching to BPE for longer ones, thereby offering, for the first time, the capability to efficiently handle arbitrarily long DNA/RNA sequences. 1",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Automated blood vessel segmentation is critical for biomedical image analysis, as vessel morphology changes are associated with numerous pathologies. Still, precise segmentation is difficult due to the complexity of vascular structures, anatomical variations across patients, the scarcity of annotated public datasets, and the quality of images. Our goal is to provide a foundation on the topic and identify a robust baseline model for application to vascular segmentation using a new imaging modality, Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT). We begin with an extensive review of current machine learning approaches for vascular segmentation across various organs. Our work introduces a meticulously curated training dataset, verified by double annotators, consisting of vascular data from three kidneys imaged using Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) as part of the Human Organ Atlas Project. HiP-CT, pioneered at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 2020, revolutionizes 3D organ imaging by offering resolution around 20µm/voxel, and enabling highly detailed localized zooms up to 1µm/voxel without physical sectioning. We leverage the nnU-Net framework to evaluate model performance on this high-resolution dataset, using both known and novel samples, and implementing metrics tailored for vascular structures. Our comprehensive review and empirical analysis on HiP-CT data sets a new standard for evaluating machine learning models in high-resolution organ imaging. Our three experiments yielded Dice scores of 0.9523 and 0.9410, and 0.8585, respectively. Nevertheless, DSC primarily assesses voxel-to-voxel concordance, overlooking several crucial characteristics of the vessels and should not be the sole metric for deciding the performance of vascular segmentation. Our results show that while segmentations yielded reasonably high scores—such as centerline Dice values ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, certain errors persisted. Specifically, large vessels that collapsed due to the lack of hydro-static pressure (HiP-CT is an ex vivo technique) were segmented poorly. Moreover, decreased connectivity in finer vessels and higher segmentation errors at vessel boundaries were observed. Such errors, particularly in significant vessels, obstruct the understanding of the structures by interrupting vascular tree connectivity. Through our review and outputs, we aim to set a benchmark for subsequent model evaluations using various modalities, especially with the HiP-CT imaging database.</p>",

      "abstract": "Deep learning models are transforming biological research. Many bioinformatics and comparative genomics algorithms analyze genomic data, either DNA or protein sequences. Examples include sequence alignments, phylogenetic tree inference and automatic classification of protein functions. Among these deep learning algorithms, models for processing natural languages, developed in the natural language processing (NLP) community, were recently applied to biological sequences. However, biological sequences are different than natural languages, such as English, and French, in which segmentation of the text to separate words is relatively straightforward. Moreover, biological sequences are characterized by extremely long sentences, which hamper their processing by current machine-learning models, notably the transformer architecture. In NLP, one of the first processing steps is to transform the raw text to a list of tokens. Deep-learning applications to biological sequence data mostly segment proteins and DNA to single characters. In this work, we study the effect of alternative tokenization algorithms on eight different tasks in biology, from predicting the function of proteins and their stability, through nucleotide sequence alignment, to classifying proteins to specific families. We demonstrate that applying alternative tokenization algorithms can increase accuracy and at the same time, substantially reduce the input length compared to the trivial tokenizer in which each character is a token. Furthermore, applying these tokenization algorithms allows interpreting trained models, taking into account dependencies among positions. Finally, we trained these tokenizers on a large dataset of protein sequences containing more than 400 billion amino acids, which resulted in over a three-fold decrease in the number of tokens. We then tested these tokenizers trained on large-scale data on the above specific tasks and showed that for some tasks it is highly beneficial to train database-specific tokenizers. Our study suggests that tokenizers are likely to be a critical component in future deep-network analysis of biological sequence data.",

      "abstract": "The rapid expansion of high-throughput sequencing technologies and the completion of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies have transformed genomics into a data-driven discipline, shifting the research focus from data generation to large-scale computational discovery. This literature review synthesizes foundational and emergent pathways in bioinformatics, genomics, and their integration into health applications. We examine the critical role of genomic reproducibility and benchmarking in establishing clinical trust, alongside mathematical models for comparative genomics, such as the Double-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) distance. A significant portion of this review is dedicated to methodological shifts in representation learning, specifically evaluating the impact of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization on genomic language models and the dominance of repetitive elements in sequence vocabularies. Furthermore, we explore the evolution of deep learning architectures, contrasting traditional convolutional and recurrent neural networks with recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs). These emergent architectures, such as Caduceus and Mamba, demonstrate linear-time complexity and superior performance in capturing long-range regulatory dependencies across ultra-long genomic sequences. Finally, we discuss how these computational innovations converge to support the goals of precision medicine. By mapping these trajectories, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the technical and theoretical challenges inherent in modeling the complexity of the human genome for clinical and biological insights.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Motivation</h4> Recent advances in multimodal single-cell omics technologies enable multiple modalities of molecular attributes, such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein abundance, to be profiled simultaneously at a global level in individual cells. While the increasing availability of multiple data modalities is expected to provide a more accurate clustering and characterisation of cells, the development of computational methods that are capable of extracting information embedded across data modalities is still in its infancy. <h4>Results</h4> We propose SnapCCESS for clustering cells by integrating data modalities in multimodal singlecell omics data using an unsupervised ensemble deep learning framework. By creating snapshots of embeddings of multimodality using variational autoencoders, SnapCCESS can be coupled with various clustering algorithms for generating consensus clustering of cells. We applied SnapCCESS with several clustering algorithms to various datasets generated from popular multimodal single-cell omics technologies. Our results demonstrate that SnapCCESS is effective and more efficient than conventional ensemble deep learning-based clustering methods and outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal embedding generation methods in integrating data modalities for clustering cells. The improved clustering of cells from SnapCCESS will pave the way for more accurate characterisation of cell identity and types, an essential step for various downstream analyses of multimodal single-cell omics data. <h4>Availability and implementation</h4> SnapCCESS is implemented as a Python package and is freely available from https://github.com/yulijia/SnapCCESS .",

Presently, histopathology workflows heavily rely on hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and serial immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, a cumbersome, tissue-exhaustive process that results in non-aligned tissue images. We propose the VirtualMultiplexer, a generative AI toolkit that effectively synthesizes multiplexed IHC images for several antibody markers only from an input H&E image. The VirtualMultiplexer captures biologically relevant staining patterns across tissue scales without requiring consecutive tissue sections, image registration, or extensive expert annotations. Thorough qualitative and quantitative assessment indicates that the VirtualMultiplexer achieves rapid, robust and precise generation of virtually multiplexed imaging datasets of high staining quality that are indistinguishable from the real ones. The VirtualMultiplexer is successfully transferred across tissue-scales, patient cohorts, and cancer types with no need for model fine-tuning. Crucially, the virtually multiplexed images enabled training a Graph-Transformer that simultaneously learns from the joint spatial distribution of several proteins to predict clinically relevant endpoints. We observe that this multiplexed learning scheme was able to greatly improve the clinical prediction, as corroborated across several downstream tasks, independent patient cohorts and cancer types. Our results showcase the clinical relevance of AI-assisted multiplexed tumor imaging, accelerating histopathology workflows and cancer biology.</p>",

      "abstract": "Deciphering how nucleotides in genomes encode regulatory instructions and molecular machines is a long-standing goal in biology. DNA language models (LMs) implicitly capture functional elements and their organization from genomic sequences alone by modeling probabilities of each nucleotide given its sequence context. However, using DNA LMs for discovering functional genomic elements has been challenging due to the lack of interpretable methods. Here, we introduce nucleotide dependencies which quantify how nucleotide substitutions at one genomic position affect the probabilities of nucleotides at other positions. We generated genome-wide maps of pairwise nucleotide dependencies within kilobase ranges for animal, fungal, and bacterial species. We show that nucleotide dependencies indicate deleteriousness of human genetic variants more effectively than sequence alignment and DNA LM reconstruction. Regulatory elements appear as dense blocks in dependency maps, enabling the systematic identification of transcription factor binding sites as accurately as models trained on experimental binding data. Nucleotide dependencies also highlight bases in contact within RNA structures, including pseudoknots and tertiary structure contacts, with remarkable accuracy. This led to the discovery of four novel, experimentally validated RNA structures in Escherichia coli. Finally, using dependency maps, we reveal critical limitations of several DNA LM architectures and training sequence selection strategies by benchmarking and visual diagnosis. Altogether, nucleotide dependency analysis opens a new avenue for discovering and studying functional elements and their interactions in genomes.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4> Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a syndrome that affects multiple organ systems and is the most severe hypertensive disorder in pregnancy. It frequently leads to preterm delivery, maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and life-long complications 1 . We currently lack efficient screening tools 2, 3 and early therapies 4, 5 to address PE. To investigate the early stages of early onset PE, and identify candidate markers and pathways, we performed spatio-temporal multi-omics profiling of human PE placentae and healthy controls and validated targets in early gestation in a longitudinal clinical cohort. We used a single-nuclei RNA-seq approach combined with spatial proteo- and transcriptomics and mechanistic in vitro signalling analyses to bridge the gap from late pregnancy disease to early pregnancy pathomechanisms. We discovered a key disruption in villous trophoblast differentiation, which is driven by the increase of transcriptional coactivator p300, that ultimately ends with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of trophoblasts. We found a significant increase in the senescence marker activin A in preeclamptic maternal serum in early gestation, before the development of clinical symptoms, indicating a translation of the placental syndrome to the maternal side. Our work describes a new disease progression, starting with a disturbed transition in villous trophoblast differentiation. Our study identifies potential pathophysiology-relevant biomarkers for the early diagnosis of the disease as well as possible targets for interventions, which would be crucial steps toward protecting the mother and child from gestational mortality and morbidity and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life.",

      "abstract": "Anti-cancer drug response prediction (DRP) using cancer cell lines plays a vital role in stratified medicine and drug discovery. Recently there has been a surge of new deep learning (DL) models for DRP that improve on the performance of their predecessors. However, different models use different input data types and neural network architectures making it hard to find the source of these improvements. Here we consider multiple published DRP models that report state-of-the-art performance in predicting continuous drug response values. These models take the chemical structures of drugs and omics profiles of cell lines as input. By experimenting with these models and comparing with our own simple benchmarks we show that no performance comes from drug features, instead, performance is due to the transcriptomics cell line profiles. Furthermore, we show that, depending on the testing type, much of the current reported performance is a property of the training target values. To address these limitations we create novel models (BinaryET and BinaryCB) that predict binary drug response values, guided by the hypothesis that this reduces the noise in the drug efficacy data. Thus, better aligning them with biochemistry that can be learnt from the input data. BinaryCB leverages a chemical foundation model, while BinaryET is trained from scratch using a transformer-type model. We show that these models learn useful chemical drug features, which is the first time this has been demonstrated for multiple DRP testing types to our knowledge. We further show binarising the drug response values is what causes the models to learn useful chemical drug features. We also show that BinaryET improves performance over BinaryCB, and over the published models that report state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Innate cortical organisation and postnatal sensory experience interact dynamically to shape the functional architecture of the human brain. Using naturalistic stimulation, functional gradient analyses, and comparative approaches in congenitally blind, congenitally deaf, and typically developed individuals, we investigated how intrinsic hierarchical structures and sensory experiences influence cortical organisation. Our findings demonstrate that the principal functional gradients spanning from unimodal sensory to transmodal association cortices are consistently preserved across all groups, suggesting a robust genetically determined cortical scaffold. Nonetheless, congenital sensory deprivation selectively reshapes the geometry of modality-specific gradients, characterised by reduced functional differentiation within sensory-deprived cortical regions. These geometric contractions promote experience-driven plastic reorganization, enabling deprived sensory areas to establish enhanced functional connectivity with transmodal and non-deprived sensory cortices. Critically, this reorganisation aligns systematically with pre-existing cortical gradients, highlighting intrinsic hierarchical constraints that guide experience-dependent plasticity. Moreover, sensory-deprived regions exhibiting heightened connectivity actively engage in processing structured perceptual information from intact modalities, reflecting specific feature-driven cross-modal adaptations. Collectively, these results underscore a fundamental duality in cortical organisation: innate hierarchical principles impose constraints on cortical architecture, while sensory experience drives adaptive refinement, demonstrating the brain’s intrinsic capacity for flexible functional reconfiguration in response to sensory deprivation.</p>",

      "abstract": "The increasing availability of large-scale single-cell datasets has enabled the detailed description of cell states across multiple biological conditions and perturbations. In parallel, recent advances in unsupervised machine learning, particularly in transfer learning, have enabled fast and scalable mapping of these new single-cell datasets onto reference atlases. The resulting large-scale machine learning models however often have millions of parameters, rendering interpretation of the newly mapped datasets challenging. Here, we propose expiMap, a deep learning model that enables interpretable reference mapping using biologically understandable entities, such as curated sets of genes and gene programs. The key concept is the substitution of the uninterpretable nodes in an autoencoder’s bottleneck by labeled nodes mapping to interpretable lists of genes, such as gene ontologies, biological pathways, or curated gene sets, for which activities are learned as constraints during reconstruction. This is enabled by the incorporation of predefined gene programs into the reference model, and at the same time allowing the model to learn de novo new programs and refine existing programs during reference mapping. We show that the model retains similar integration performance as existing methods while providing a biologically interpretable framework for understanding cellular behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of expiMap by applying it to 15 datasets encompassing five different tissues and species. The interpretable nature of the mapping revealed unreported associations between interferon signaling via the RIG-I/MDA5 and GPCRs pathways, with differential behavior in CD8 + T cells and CD14 + monocytes in severe COVID-19, as well as the role of annexins in the cellular communications between lymphoid and myeloid compartments for explaining patient response to the applied drugs. Finally, expiMap enabled the direct comparison of a diverse set of pancreatic beta cells from multiple studies where we observed a strong, previously unreported correlation between the unfolded protein response and asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Altogether, expiMap enables the interpretable mapping of single cell transcriptome data sets across cohorts, disease states and other perturbations.",

These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose couple CoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. couple CoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In couple CoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. couple CoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, couple CoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying couple CoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that couple CoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. couple CoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient.

However, the efficacy of these models, particularly in zero-shot settings where models are not fine-tuned but used without any further training, remains an open question, especially as practical constraints require useful models to function in settings that preclude fine-tuning (e.g., discovery settings where labels are not fully known). This paper presents a rigorous evaluation of the zero-shot performance of these proposed single-cell foundation models. We assess their utility in tasks such as cell type clustering and batch effect correction, and evaluate the generality of their pretraining objectives. Our results indicate that both Geneformer and scGPT exhibit limited reliability in zero-shot settings and often underperform compared to simpler methods.

To extend this approach to non-UMI data, we model the additional amplification step with a compound distribution: we assume that sequenced RNA molecules follow a negative binomial distribution, and are then replicated following an amplification distribution. We show how this model leads to compound Pearson residuals, which yield meaningful gene selection and embeddings of Smart-seq2 datasets. Further, we suggest that amplification distributions across several sequencing protocols can be described by a broken power law. The resulting compound model captures previously unexplained overdispersion and zero-inflation patterns in non-UMI data.",

Developing foundation models in life science for deciphering the “languages” of cells and facilitating biomedical research is promising yet challenging. We developed a large-scale pretrained model scFoundation with 100M parameters for this purpose. scFoundation was trained on over 50 million human single-cell transcriptomics data, which contain high-throughput observations on the complex molecular features in all known types of cells. scFoundation is currently the largest model in terms of the size of trainable parameters, dimensionality of genes and the number of cells used in the pre-training.

      "title": "A Transformer-Based Ensemble Approach For DNA Splice Junction Classification",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>The precise foretelling of DNA splice junctions is one of the most fundamental problems in computational biology and is also important for understanding the structure and function of the gene. The most complex thing is identifying the type of junction IE, EI or N from the given DNA sequence. Junction prediction is critical for determining the gene expression patterns, splicing regulation, disease etiology and genome architecture. It is very difficult to localize the boundaries for intron removal and exon inclusion, because there is no single rule that governs the process of RNA splicing. To address this problem, the proposed work incorporates an ensemble learning approach in the form of a two-layered hybrid model. In the first layer, feature extraction is done by two transformers DNABERT and DISTILBERT. DNABERT, a transformer model tailored for DNA sequences, is pre-trained on genomic data using the masked language model approach, which helps capturing long and short range dependencies, hence improving feature extraction. DISTILBERT’s lighter architecture ensures that efficient feature extraction, while maintaining competitive performance. The second layer uses Stacking Ensemble classification model trained on the features fed into it from the first layer. The proposed model splits the splice junction dataset into training and testing sets using cross validation, allowing a thorough analysis of the classifier’s generalization capacity. The ensemble model is trained on various divisions of training set and testing set. The UCI splice junction dataset was used to test our approach. In contrast to other machine learning models for DNA splice junction classification, the proposed DNABERT + Stacking ensemble method achieved an accuracy of 95%, and the DISTILBERT+ Stacking ensemble method achieved an accuracy of 91%. These findings specify that DNABERT transformer is better suited for tasks requiring detail contextual understanding , DISTILBERT transformer offers significant computational efficiency, making it a better choice for applications with resource constraints.</p>",

      "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic modification, regulates gene expression, influences phenotypes, and encodes inheritable information, making it critical for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. While human genome contains approximately 28 million CpG sites where DNAm can be measured, only 1–3% of these sites are typically available in most datasets due to complex experimental protocols and high costs, hindering insights from DNAm data. Leveraging the relationship between gene expression and DNAm offers promise for computational inference, but existing statistical, machine learning, and masking-based generative Transformers face critical limitations: they cannot infer DNAm at unmeasured CpGs or in new samples effectively. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MethylProphet, a gene-guided, context-aware Transformer model designed for DNAm inference. MethylProphet employs a Bottleneck MLP for efficient gene profile compression and a specialized DNA sequence tokenizer, integrating global gene expression patterns with local CpG context through a Transformer encoder architecture. Trained on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from ENCODE (1.6B training CpG-sample pairs; 322B tokens), MethylProphet demonstrates strong performance in hold-out evaluations, effectively inferring DNAm for unmeasured CpGs and new samples. In addition, its application to 10842 pairs of gene expression and DNAm samples at TCGA chromosome 1 (450M training CpGsample pairs; 91B tokens) highlights its potential to facilitate pan-cancer DNAm landscape inference, offering a powerful tool for advancing epigenetic research and precision medicine.

      "abstract": "The AI Virtual Cell (AIVC) framework promises to revolutionize biological research through high-fidelity simulations of cellular behaviors and responses to perturbations. Central to realizing this vision is the ability to model cell differentiation dynamics, which requires accurate inference of gene regulatory network (GRN) that govern cell fate decisions. However, existing computational approaches rely on static GRN models that fail to capture the dynamic changes of regulatory relationships during differentiation, limiting their utility for simulating developmental processes and predicting perturbation outcomes. Here, we present CellProphet, an interpretable AI model that infers dynamic GRN by integrating temporal causality with transformer self-attention mechanism. CellProphet captures time-lagged dependencies between transcription factor (TF) expression and target gene activation while providing interpretable regulatory weights, enabling both accurate prediction and mechanistic insight. When benchmarked against nine state-of-the-art methods across seven differentiation datasets, CellProphet achieves superior performance in all evaluation metrics. Applied to mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation, CellProphet identifies both well-known and potentially novel TFs with substantially high sensitivity and successfully reconstructs dynamic regulatory relations validated through multi-modal epigenomic data. In mouse hematopoietic differentiation, CellProphet accurately predicts cell fate transitions and gene expression changes following in silico perturbation of key TFs Gata1 and Spi1 , demonstrating its capability for virtual experimentation. These results establish CellProphet as a foundational tool for the AIVC framework, enabling researchers to decode the dynamic regulatory logic of differentiation, accelerate discovery of key regulatory factors, and design targeted cellular interventions for widespread applications.",

In this study, a two-stage feature extraction framework using eight state-of-the-art pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and an autoencoder is proposed to determine the health conditions of patients (COVID-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia) based on chest X-rays. The X-ray scans are divided into four equally sized sections and analyzed by deep pre-trained CNNs. Subsequently, an autoencoder with three hidden layers is trained to extract reproductive features from the concatenated ouput of CNNs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, three different classifiers, which are single-layer perceptron (SLP), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) are used. Furthermore, the deep CNN architectures are used to create benchmark models and trained on the same dataset for comparision. The proposed framework outperforms other frameworks wih pre-trained feature extractors in binary classification and shows competitive results in three-class classification. The proposed methodology is task-independent and suitable for addressing various problems. The results show that the discriminative features are a subset of the reproductive features, suggesting that extracting task-independent features is superior to the extraction only task-based features. The flexibility and task-independence of the reproductive features make the conceptive information approach more favorable.

      "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made in developing machine learning models for predicting human functional variants, but progress in livestock species has been more limited. This is despite the disproportionate potential benefits such models could have to livestock research, from improving breeding values to prioritising functional variants at trait-associated loci. A key open question is what datasets and modelling approaches are most important to close this performance gap between species. In this work we have developed a new framework for predicting regulatory variants, that includes deriving key conservation metrics in cattle for the first time, variant annotation and model training. When trained on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data for human and cattle we show that this framework has a high performance at predicting regulatory variants, with a maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.86 in human and 0.81 in cattle. We explore various approaches to further close this performance gap, including integrating advanced DNA sequence models and generating extra chromatin data, but illustrate that the best approach would be generating improved gold-standard sets of known cattle regulatory variants. Importantly we demonstrate both the human and cattle models substantially enrich for variants linked to important traits, with up to 18-fold enrichments for functional variants observed. Consequently, with our framework developed to be applicable across species these results not only demonstrate its potential utility for fine-mapping functional variants and improving breeding values in cattle, but also its potential for wider use across animal species.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of DNA foundation language models has brought about a transformative shift in genomics, allowing for the deciphering of intricate patterns and regulatory mechanisms embedded within DNA sequences. The genomic foundation model Evo2 demonstrates remarkable capabilities in decoding DNA functional patterns through cross-species pretraining. However, despite the great potential of Evo2 in basic genomics research, there is currently no clear and systematic guidance on its specific application scenarios, performance, and optimization directions in the field of tumor genomics, and its performance dependency on specialized hardware (such as FP8 precision on H800 GPUs) has not been empirically benchmarked. Here, we present a focused validation of Evo2 using two independent cancer genomic datasets (Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma and Ovarian Cancer), we tested the downstream tasks of Evo2, including the prediction of tumor pathogenic variants and the prediction of mutational effects, and compared its performance on A100 and H800 GPUs. The results show that critical importance of FP8 precision, enabling the H800 to achieve a 4× faster inference speed than the A100 with stable accuracy (AUC 0.88-0.95). The 7B-parameter model emerged as the top performer, whereas the 40B model experienced a severe performance drop (AUC to 0.48) on non-FP8 hardware like the A100. These findings empirically validated Evo2’s hardware specifications and provided practical insights for researchers implementing the model with similar computational resources. Futhermore, our findings provide a framework for the application and optimization of downstream tasks of the DNA language model Evo2 in cancer, and can guide researchers in effectively applying it in genomic studies. <h4>Key Points</h4>  Hardware Precision Impact: FP8 precision on H800 GPUs is critical for Evo 2’s performance, enabling 4× faster inference than A100 (without FP8 support) while maintaining high accuracy (AUC 0.88–0.95). Model Scale Optimization: The 7B-parameter model outperformed larger variants (e.g., 40B), which suffered severe accuracy drops (AUC as low as 0.48) on non-FP8 hardware, highlighting a balance between efficiency and performance. Practical Guidelines: We provide a framework for deploying Evo 2 in cancer genomics, including hardware recommendations, dataset curation, and downstream task optimization—valuable for researchers with varied computational resources.",

      "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are crucial in genetics for predicting individual susceptibility to complex diseases by aggregating the effects of numerous genetic variants. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized our ability to detect rare and even de novo variants, creating an exciting opportunity for developing new PRS methods that can effectively leverage rare variants and capture the complex relationships among different variants. Furthermore, regulatory mechanisms play a crucial role in gene expression and disease manifestation, offering avenues to further enhance the performance and interpretation of PRS predictions. Through simulation studies, we highlighted aspects where current PRS methods face challenges when applied to WGS data, aiming to shed light on potential opportunities for further improvement. To address these challenges, we developed Epi-PRS, an approach that leverages the power of genomic large language models (LLM) to impute epigenomic signals across diverse cellular contexts, for use as intermediate variables between genotype and phenotype. A pretrained LLM is employed to transform genotypes into epigenomic signals using personal diploid sequences as inputs, and the genetic risk is then estimated based on the imputed personal epigenomic signals. Epi-PRS enhances the assessment of personal variant impacts, enabling a comprehensive and holistic consideration of genotypic and regulatory information within large genomic regions. Our simulation results demonstrated that incorporating the nuanced effects of non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory information can provide more precise PRS prediction and better understanding of genetic risk. Applying Epi-PRS to real data from the UK Biobank, our results further showed that Epi-PRS significantly outperforms existing PRS methods in two major diseases: breast cancer and diabetes. This study suggests that PRS methods can benefit from incorporating non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory information, highlighting the potential for significant advancements in disease risk modeling and enhancing the understanding of precision medicine. <h4>Significance Statement</h4> Epi-PRS improves polygenic risk scoring by integrating genomic large language models (LLMs) to impute epigenomic signals as intermediaries between genotype and phenotype. This approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of personal variant impacts by incorporating non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory mechanisms. By leveraging the power of genomic LLM trained on massive amount of reference epigenomics data, Epi-PRS has demonstrated superior performance over existing PRS methods in predicting genetic risk for breast cancer and diabetes in UK Biobank data. These results highlight the potential of Epi-PRS to improve disease risk modeling and advance the field of precision medicine.",

Contrastive learning algorithms have recently shown cutting-edge performance in extracting representations from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals that characterize cross-temporal cardiovascular state. However, there is currently no connection between these representations and genetics. <h4>Methods</h4> We designed a new metric, denoted as Delta ECG, which measures temporal shifts in patients’ cardiovascular state, and inherently adjusts for inter-patient differences at baseline. We extracted this measure for 4,782 patients in the Human Phenotype Project using a novel self-supervised learning model, and quantified the associated genetic signals with Genome-Wide-Association Studies (GWAS). We predicted the expression of thousands of genes extracted from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). Downstream, we ran enrichment and overrepresentation analysis of genes we identified as significantly predicted from ECG. <h4>Findings</h4> In a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of Delta ECG, we identified five associations that achieved genome-wide significance. From baseline embeddings, our models significantly predict the expression of 57 genes in men and 9 in women. Enrichment analysis showed that these genes were predominantly associated with the electron transport chain and the same immune pathways as identified in our GWAS. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We validate a novel method integrating self-supervised learning in the medical domain and simple linear models in genetics. Our results indicate that the processes underlying temporal changes in cardiovascular health share a genetic basis with CVD, its major risk factors, and its known correlates. Moreover, our functional analysis confirms the importance of leukocytes, specifically eosinophils and mast cells with respect to cardiac structure and function.",

One of the limitations is laborious manual segmentation of regions-of-interest (ROI). We present a deep learning auto-segmentation pipeline for radiomic analysis. <h4>Patients and Methods</h4> 153 patients with resected stage 2A-3B non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCs) had tumours segmented using nnU-Net with review by two clinicians. The nnU-Net was pretrained with anatomical priors in non-cancerous lungs and finetuned on NSCLCs. Three ROIs were segmented: intra-tumoural, peri-tumoural, and whole lung. 1967 features were extracted using PyRadiomics. Feature reproducibility was tested using segmentation perturbations. Features were selected using minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance with Random Forest-recursive feature elimination nested in 500 bootstraps. <h4>Results</h4> Auto-segmentation time was ∼36 seconds/series. Mean volumetric and surface Dice-Sørensen coefficient (DSC) scores were 0.84 (±0.28), and 0.79 (±0.34) respectively. DSC were significantly correlated with tumour shape (sphericity, diameter) and location (worse with chest wall adherence), but not batch effects (e.g. contrast, reconstruction kernel). 6.5% cases had ‘missed’ segmentations; 6.5% required major changes. Pre-training on anatomical priors resulted in better segmentations compared to training on tumour-labels alone ( p <0.001) and tumour with anatomical labels ( p <0.001). Most radiomic features were not reproducible following perturbations and resampling. Adding radiomic features, however, did not significantly improve the clinical model in predicting 2-year disease-free survival: AUCs 0.67 (95%CI 0.59-0.75) vs 0.63 (95%CI 0.54-0.71) respectively ( p =0.28). <h4>Conclusion</h4> Our study demonstrates that integrating auto-segmentation into radio-biomarker discovery is feasible with high efficiency and accuracy. Whilst radiomic analysis show limited reproducibility, our auto-segmentation may allow more robust radio-biomarker analysis using deep learning features.",

      "abstract": "Generative genomics models can design increasingly complex biological systems. However, effectively controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic “autocomplete” in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process “semantic mining,” which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions. The semantic mining paradigm enables functional exploration that ventures beyond the observed evolutionary universe.",

      "abstract": "The fields of taxonomy and biodiversity research have witnessed an exponential growth in published literature. This vast corpus of articles holds information on the diverse biological traits of organisms and their ecologies. However, access to and extraction of relevant data from this extensive resource remain challenging. Advances in text and data mining (TDM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques offer new opportunities for liberating such information from the literature. Testing and using such approaches to annotate articles in machine actionable formats is therefore necessary to enable the exploitation of existing knowledge in new biology, ecology, and evolution research. Here we explore the potential of these methods to annotate and extract organismal and ecological trait data for the most diverse animal group on Earth, the arthropods. The article processing workflow uses manually curated trait dictionaries with trained NLP models to perform labelling of entities and relationships of thousands of articles. A subset of manually annotated documents facilitated the formal evaluation of the performance of the workflow in terms of entity recognition and normalisation, and relationship extraction, highlighting several important technical challenges. The results are made available to the scientific community through an interactive web tool and queryable resource, the ArTraDB Arthropod Trait Database. These methodological explorations provide a framework that could be extended beyond the arthropods, where TDM and NLP approaches applied to the taxonomy and biodiversity literature will greatly facilitate data synthesis studies and literature reviews, the identification of knowledge gaps and biases, as well as the data-informed investigation of ecological and evolutionary trends and patterns.",

      "abstract": "Complex deep learning models trained on very large datasets have become key enabling tools for current research in natural language processing and computer vision. By providing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific applications, they enable researchers to create accurate models with minimal effort and computational resources. Large scale genomics deep learning models come in two flavors: the first are large language models of DNA sequences trained in a self-supervised fashion, similar to the corresponding natural language models; the second are supervised learning models that leverage large scale genomics datasets from ENCODE and other sources. We argue that these models are the equivalent of foundation models in natural language processing in their utility, as they encode within them chromatin state in its different aspects, providing useful representations that allow quick deployment of accurate models of gene regulation. We demonstrate this premise by leveraging the recently created Sei model to develop simple, interpretable models of intron retention, and demonstrate their advantage over models based on the DNA langauage model DNABERT-2. Our work also demonstrates the impact of chromatin state on the regulation of intron retention. Using representations learned by Sei, our model is able to discover the involvement of transcription factors and chromatin marks in regulating intron retention, providing better accuracy than a recently published custom model developed for this purpose.",

Yet, combining these different types of information from multiple datasets into a joint representation is complicated by the unique characteristics of each modality and the technical effects between datasets. Here, we present mvTCR , a multimodal generative model to learn a unified representation across modalities and datasets for joint analysis of single-cell immune profiling data. We show that mvTCR allows the construction of large-scale and multimodal T-cell atlases by distilling modality-specific properties into a shared view, enabling unique and improved data analysis. Specifically, we demonstrated mvTCR’s potential by revealing and separating SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell clusters from bystanders that would have been missed in individual unimodal data analysis. Finally, mvTCR can enable automated analysis of new datasets when combined with transfer-learning approaches. Overall, mvTCR provides a principled solution for standard analysis tasks such as multimodal integration, clustering, specificity analysis, and batch correction for single-cell immune profiling data.",

      "abstract": "The subcellular localisation of proteins is a key determinant of their function. High-throughput analyses of these localisations can be performed using mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics, which enables us to examine the localisation and relocalisation of proteins. Furthermore, complementary data sources can provide additional sources of functional or localisation information. Examples include protein annotations and other high-throughput ‘omic assays. Integrating these modalities can provide new insights as well as additional confidence in results, but existing approaches for integrative analyses of spatial proteomics datasets are limited in the types of data they can integrate and do not quantify uncertainty. Here we propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach to integrate spatial proteomics datasets with other data sources, to improve the inference of protein sub-cellular localisation. We demonstrate our approach outperforms other transfer-learning methods and has greater flexibility in the data it can model. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we apply our method to integrate spatial proteomics data generated for the parasite Toxoplasma gondii with time-course gene expression data generated over its cell cycle. Our findings suggest that proteins linked to invasion organelles are associated with expression programs that peak at the end of the first cell-cycle. Furthermore, this integrative analysis divides the dense granule proteins into heterogeneous populations suggestive of potentially different functions. Our method is disseminated via the mdir R package available on the lead author’s Github. <h4>Author summary</h4> Proteins are located in subcellular environments to ensure that they are near their interaction partners and occur in the correct biochemical environment to function. Where a protein is located can be determined from a number of data sources. To integrate diverse datasets together we develop an integrative Bayesian model to combine the information from several datasets in a principled manner. We learn how similar the dataset are as part of the modelling process and demonstrate the benefits of integrating mass-spectrometry based spatial proteomics data with timecourse gene-expression datasets.",

      "abstract": "Heterogeneity in cancer gene expression is typically linked to genetic and epigenetic alterations, yet post-transcriptional regulation likely influences these patterns as well. However, the quantitative contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to cancer transcriptome dynamics remains unclear. Here, we systematically measured mRNA dynamics across diverse breast cancer models, revealing that mRNA stability significantly shapes gene expression variability. To decipher the regulatory grammar underlying these dynamics, we developed GreyHound, an interpretable multimodal deep-learning framework integrating RNA sequence features and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression. GreyHound identified an extensive network of RBPs and their regulons underlying variations in mRNA stability. Among these, we uncovered a metastasis-suppressive regulatory axis centered on the RNA-binding protein RBMS3 and its post-transcriptional control of the redox regulator TXNIP. Functional and molecular analyses revealed that RBMS3 depletion resulted in targeted transcript destabilization, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes and enhanced metastatic potential in xenograft models. Using in vivo epistasis studies, we confirmed that RBMS3 regulation of TXNIP mRNA stability drives this metastasis-suppressive program. These findings position the RBMS3-TXNIP regulatory axis as a key post-transcriptional mechanism in breast cancer and illustrate how interpretable models of RNA dynamics can uncover hidden regulatory programs in disease.",

      "abstract": "The integrative analysis of gene sets, networks, and pathways is pivotal for deciphering omics data in translational biomedical research. To significantly increase gene coverage and enhance the utility of pathways, annotated gene lists, and gene signatures from diverse sources, we introduced pathways, annotated gene lists, and gene signatures (PAGs) enriched with metadata to represent biological functions. Furthermore, we established PAG-PAG networks by leveraging gene member similarity and gene regulations. However, in practice, high similarity in functional descriptions or gene membership often leads to redundant PAGs, hindering the interpretation from a fuzzy enriched PAG list. In this study, we developed todenE (topology-based and density-based ensemble) clustering, pioneering in integrating topology-based and density-based clustering methods to detect PAG communities leveraging the PAG network and Large Language Models (LLM). In computational genomics annotation, the genes can be grouped/clustered through the gene relationships and gene functions via guilt by association. Similarly, PAGs can be grouped into higher-level clusters, forming concise functional representations called Super-PAGs. TodenE captures PAG-PAG similarity and encapsulates functional information through LLM, in characterizing network-based functional Super-PAGs. In synthetic data, we introduced a metric called the Disparity Index (DI), measuring the connectivity of gene neighbors to gauge clusterability. We compared multiple clustering algorithms to identify the best method for generating performance-driven clusters. In non-simulated data (Gene Ontology), by leveraging transfer learning and LLM, we formed a language-based similarity embedding. TodenE utilizes this embedding together with the topology-based embedding to generate putative Super-PAGs with superior performance in semantic and gene member inclusiveness.",

In our unique COVID-19 human challenge study we used single cell genomics of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in 16 seronegative individuals challenged with preAlpha-SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific timepoints or infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood precedes the nasopharynx, and that nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in transient but later in sustained infection, and thus correlated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed an acute response phase, upregulated MHC class II while infected, and were most permissive for viral replication, whilst nasal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolve 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our novel computational pipeline (Cell2TCR) identifies activated antigen-responding clonotype groups and motifs in any dataset. Together, we show that our detailed time series data ( covid19cellatlas.org ) can serve as a “Rosetta stone” for the epithelial and immune cell responses, and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection from infection.",

      "abstract": "Non-coding RNA structure and function are essential to understanding various biological processes, such as cell signaling, gene expression, and post-transcriptional regulations. These are all among the core problems in the RNA field. With the rapid growth of sequencing technology, we have accumulated a massive amount of unannotated RNA sequences. On the other hand, expensive experimental observatory results in only limited numbers of annotated data and 3D structures. Hence, it is still challenging to design computational methods for predicting their structures and functions. The lack of annotated data and systematic study causes inferior performance. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel RNA foundation model (RNA-FM) to take advantage of all the 23 million non-coding RNA sequences through self-supervised learning. Within this approach, we discover that the pre-trained RNA-FM could infer sequential and evolutionary information of non-coding RNAs without using any labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate RNA-FM's effectiveness by applying it to the downstream secondary/3D structure prediction, SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and evolution prediction, protein-RNA binding preference modeling, and gene expression regulation modeling. The comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method improves the RNA structural and functional modelling results significantly and consistently.

It uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building, and the contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, and whole organism atlases, we showcase that scArches preserves nuanced biological state information while removing batch effects in the data, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared to de novo integration. To demonstrate mapping disease variation, we show that scArches preserves detailed COVID-19 disease variation upon reference mapping, enabling discovery of new cell identities that are unseen during training. We envision our method to facilitate collaborative projects by enabling the iterative construction, updating, sharing, and efficient use of reference atlases.",

      "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer care is that patients with similar demographics, tumor types, and medical histories can respond quite differently to the same drug regimens. This difference is largely explained by genetic and other molecular variabilities among the patients and their cancers. Efforts in the pharmacogenomics field are underway to understand better the relationship between the genome of the patient’s healthy and tumor cells and their response to therapy. To advance this goal, research groups and consortia have undertaken large-scale systematic screening of panels of drugs across multiple cancer cell lines that have been molecularly profiled by genomics, proteomics, and similar techniques. These large data drug screening sets have been applied to the problem of drug response prediction (DRP), the challenge of predicting the response of a previously untested drug/cell-line combination. Although deep learning algorithms outperform traditional methods, there are still many challenges in DRP that ultimately result in these models’ low generalizability and hampers their clinical application. In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm that addresses the major shortcomings of current DRP methods by combining multiple cell line characterization data, addressing drug response data skewness, and improving chemical compound representation. The result is an open-source, Python-based, command-line program available at https://github.com/LincolnSteinLab/MMDRP .",

      "title": "Multimodal learning of noncoding variant effects using genome sequence and chromatin structure",
      "abstract": "<h4>Motivation</h4> A growing amount of noncoding genetic variants, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are found to be associated with complex human traits and diseases. Their mechanistic interpretation is relatively limited and can use the help from computational prediction of their effects on epigenetic profiles. However, current models often focus on local, 1D genome sequence determinants and disregard global, 3D chromatin structure that critically affects epigenetic events. <h4>Results</h4> We find that noncoding variants of unexpected high similarity in epigenetic profiles, with regards to their relatively low similarity in local sequences, can be largely attributed to their proximity in chromatin structure. Accordingly we have developed a multimodal deep learning scheme that incorporates both data of 1D genome sequence and 3D chromatin structure for predicting noncoding variant effects. Specifically, we have integrated convolutional and recurrent neural networks for sequence embedding and graph neural networks for structure embedding despite the resolution gap between the two types of data, while utilizing recent DNA language models. Numerical results show that our models outperform competing sequence-only models in predicting epigenetic profiles and their use of long-range interactions complement sequence-only models in extracting regulatory motifs. They prove to be excellent predictors for noncoding variant effects in gene expression and pathogenicity, whether in unsupervised “zero-shot” learning or supervised “few-shot” learning. <h4>Availability</h4> Codes and data access can be found at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/ncVarPred-1D3D <h4>Contact</h4> yshen@tamu.edu <h4>Supplementary information</h4> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight.

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly progressing technology with its applications expanding exponentially over the past decade. While initial breakthroughs predominantly focused on deep learning and computer vision, recent advancements have facilitated a shift towards natural language processing and beyond. This includes generative models, like ChatGPT, capable of understanding the ‘grammar’ of software code, analog signals, and molecular structures. This research undertakes a comprehensive examination of AI trends within the biomedical domain, including the impact of ChatGPT. We explore scientific literature, clinical trials, and FDA-approval data, utilizing a thematic synthesis approach and bibliometric mapping of keywords to examine numerous subsets from over a hundred thousand unique records found in prominent public repositories up to mid-July 2023. Our analysis reveals a higher prevalence of general health-related publications compared to more specialized papers using or evaluating ChatGPT. However, the growth in specialized papers suggests a convergence with the trend observed for other AI tools. Our findings also imply a greater prevalence of publications using ChatGPT across multiple medical specialties compared to other AI tools, indicating its rising influence in complex fields requiring interdisciplinary collaboration. Leading topics in AI literature include radiology, ethics, drug discovery, COVID-19, robotics, brain research, stroke, and laparoscopy, indicating a shift from laboratory to emergency medicine and deep-learning-based image processing. Publications involving ChatGPT predominantly address current themes such as COVID-19, practical applications, interdisciplinary collaboration, and risk mitigation. Radiology retains dominance across all stages of biomedical R&D, spanning preprints, peer-reviewed papers, clinical trials, patents, and FDA approvals. Meanwhile, surgery-focused papers appear more frequently within ChatGPT preprints and case reports. Traditionally less represented areas, such as Pediatrics, Otolaryngology, and Internal Medicine, are starting to realize the benefits of ChatGPT, hinting at its potential to spark innovation within new medical sectors. AI application in geriatrics is notably underrepresented in publications. However, ongoing clinical trials are already exploring the use of ChatGPT for managing age-related conditions. The higher frequency of general health-related publications compared to specialized papers employing or evaluating ChatGPT showcases its broad applicability across multiple fields. AI, particularly ChatGPT, possesses significant potential to reshape the future of medicine. With millions of papers published annually across various disciplines, efficiently navigating the information deluge to pinpoint valuable studies has become increasingly challenging. Consequently, AI methods, gaining in popularity, are poised to redefine the future of scientific publishing and its educational reach. Despite challenges like quality of training data and ethical concerns, prevalent in preceding AI tools, the wider applicability of ChatGPT across diverse fields is manifest.

      "title": "AI-based identification of cardiac Purkinje fiber cells isolated from whole adult sheep hearts",
      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>BACKGROUND</h4> Purkinje Fibers (PFs) are essential to the cardiac conduction system for synchronizing ventricular contractions. However, emerging evidence highlights their implication in the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Nevertheless, isolating and studying the cellular mechanisms of PFs presents a significant challenge due to their intricate arborizing structure, heterogeneous cardiomyocytes (CMs) phenotype, and relatively small proportion within the ventricular mass, all of which hinder detailed functional investigations and comprehensive analysis of the conduction system network. <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4> To develop a new methodology for dissociation and classification of cell populations related to the ventricular conduction system from adult sheep. This workflow establishes, in part, a proof-of-concept deep learning-based classification strategy that leverages standard cellular imaging data. <h4>METHODS</h4> We developed a multi-tiered workflow to isolate and classify cardiac cell populations from adult sheep hearts. Coronary perfusion and enzymatic digestion were used to dissociate CMs from the left ventricular free wall (LVMs) and Purkinje-rich free-running false tendons (FTs). A three-pronged classification strategy was developed and implemented: (1) expert-guided visual phenotyping based on distinctive morphological traits; (2) rule-based morphometric quantification using automatic image analysis; and (3) deep learning-based classification with a retrained YOLOv9 model trained on augmented brightfield image datasets. This pipeline enabled accurate discrimination between LVM and FT-derived cells. Independent validation was performed using patch-clamp electrophysiology, T-tubule structure imaging with di-8-ANEPPS, and gene expression profiling (RT-qPCR) for Purkinje-specific biomarkers (Tbx5 and Cx40). <h4>RESULTS</h4> During the qualitative inspection, FT-dissociated cells had distinct morphological features, including an elongated or slender shape, finger-like projections, curves and tortuous shapes, and a new feature: the presence of spurs along the lateral membrane. Subsequently, a YOLOv9 model achieved an accuracy of 98% in distinguishing LVM and FT cells, based on the initial visual selection made by the operator. In addition, FT-cells exhibit a lower organization and density of T-Tubules compared to LVM. This classification was confirmed by the characterization of the typically longer action potential (AP) durations in FT cells. Finally, higher mRNA expression of the transcription factor Tbx5 and connexin40 (Cx40) was observed in FTs compared to left ventricular tissues. <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4> We present a robust and scalable workflow for isolating and classifying cardiac Purkinje fiber cells from adult sheep, integrating manual phenotyping, rule-based morphometrics, and AI-driven deep learning. This multimodal approach enables high-accuracy identification of PF cells within heterogeneous tissue, confirmed through structural, molecular, and electrophysiological validation. Our findings overcome long-standing barriers in Purkinje fiber research and provide a powerful platform for advancing the study of ventricular conduction system biology and its role in arrhythmogenesis. <h4>GRAPHIC ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>WHAT IS KNOWN</h4> The PFs network constitutes a small part of the ventricular mass (<2%) but ensures spatio-temporal dynamic of ventricular activation. The PFs are known to have distinct electrophysiological and Ca 2+ dynamic compared to surrounding myocardial tissue. Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and recent evidence points to an essential contribution of PFs. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of PF-induced arrhythmias, partly because their isolation remains challenging. <h4>WHAT THE– STUDY ADDS</h4> A new dissociation technique combined with advanced AI methods to accurately dissociate and discriminate LVM and PF cells derived from free FT dissociation. This improves the classification system for distinguishing morphological LVM cells from PF cells in sheep. Our model opens up new perspectives in the automatic analysis of various cell parameters.",

      "title": "Enhancer grammar of liver cell types and hepatocyte zonation states",
      "abstract": "Cell type identity is encoded by gene regulatory networks (GRN), in which transcription factors (TFs) bind to enhancers to regulate target gene expression. In the mammalian liver, lineage TFs have been characterized for the main cell types, including hepatocytes. Hepatocytes cover a relatively broad cellular state space, as they differ significantly in their metabolic state, and function, depending on their position with respect to the central or portal vein in a liver lobule. It is unclear whether this spatially defined cellular state space, called zonation, is also governed by a well-defined gene regulatory code. To address this challenge, we have mapped enhancer-GRNs across liver cell types at high resolution, using a combination of single cell multiomics, spatial omics, GRN inference, and deep learning. We found that cell state changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells depend on zonation. Enhancer-GRN mapping suggests that zonation states in hepatocytes are driven by the repressors Tcf7l1 and Tbx3, that modulate the core hepatocyte GRN, controlled by Hnf4a, Cebpa, Hnf1a, Onecut1 and Foxa1, among others. To investigate how these TFs cooperate with cell type TFs, we performed an in vivo massively parallel reporter assay on 12,000 hepatocyte enhancers and used these data to train a hierarchical deep learning model (called DeepLiver) that exploits both enhancer accessibility and activity. DeepLiver confirms Cebpa, Onecut, Foxa1, Hnf1a and Hnf4a as drivers of enhancer specificity in hepatocytes; Tcf7l1/2 and Tbx3 as regulators of the zonation state; and Hnf4a, Hnf1a, AP-1 and Ets as activators. Finally, taking advantage of in silico mutagenesis predictions from DeepLiver and enhancer assays, we confirmed that the destruction of Tcf7l1/2 or Tbx3 motifs in zonated enhancers abrogates their zonation bias. Our study provides a multi-modal understanding of the regulatory code underlying hepatocyte identity and their zonation state, that can be exploited to engineer enhancers with specific activity levels and zonation patterns.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II proteins present peptides to CD4 + T cells through an interaction with T cell receptors (TCRs). Thus, HLA proteins are key players in shaping immunogenicity and immunodominance. Nevertheless, factors governing peptide presentation by HLA-II proteins are still poorly understood. To address this problem, we profiled the blood transcriptome and immunopeptidome of 20 healthy individuals and integrated the profiles with publicly available immunopeptidomics datasets. In depth multi-omics analysis identified expression levels and subcellular locations as import sequence-independent features governing presentation. Levering this knowledge, we developed the Peptide Immune Annotator Multimodal ( PIA-M ) tool, as a novel pan multimodal transformer-based framework that utilises sequence-dependent along with sequence-independent features to model presentation by HLA-II proteins. PIA-M illustrated a consistently superior performance relative to existing tools across two independent test datasets (area under the curve: 0.93 vs. 0.84 and 0.95 vs. 0.86), respectively. Besides achieving a higher predictive accuracy, PIA-M with its Rust-based pre-processing engine, had significantly shorter runtimes. PIA-M is freely available with a permissive licence as a standalone pipeline and as a webserver ( https://hybridcomputing.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/pia ). In conclusion, PIA-M enables a new state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting peptide presentation by HLA-II proteins in vivo .",

However, current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods lack interpretability due to the “black box” nature, impeding its further applications in the areas that require explanation. <h4>Results</h4> We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques. conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression, spatial information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks, including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference, cell-to-cell interaction, etc . Extensive experiments in various datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed conST, achieving up to 10% improvement in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark dataset. We also show that the learned embedding can be used in complicated scenarios, such as predicting cancer progression by analyzing the tumour microenvironment and cell-to-cell interaction (CCI) of breast cancer. Our framework is interpretable in that it is able to find the correlated spots that support the clustering, which matches the CCI interaction pairs as well, providing more confidence to clinicians when making clinical decisions.",

      "abstract": "Initially introduced in 1909 by William Bateson, classic epistasis (genetic variant interaction) refers to the phenomenon that one variant prevents another variant from a different locus from manifesting its effects. The potential effects of genetic variant interactions on complex diseases have been recognized for the past decades. Moreover, It has been studied and demonstrated that leveraging the combined SNP effects within the genetic block can significantly increase calculation power, reducing background noise, ultimately leading to novel epistasis discovery that the single SNP statistical epistasis study might overlook. However, it is still an open question how we can best combine gene structure representation modelling and interaction learning into an end-to-end model for gene interaction searching. Here, in the current study, we developed a neural genetic block interaction searching model that can effectively process large SNP chip inputs and output the potential genetic block interaction heatmap. Our model augments a previously published hierarchical transformer architecture (Liu and Lapata, 2019) with the ability to model genetic blocks. The cross-block relationship mapping was achieved via a hierarchical attention mechanism which allows the sharing of information regarding specific phenotypes, as opposed to simple unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods e.g. PCA. Results on both simulation and UK Biobank studies show our model brings substantial improvements compared to traditional exhaustive searching and neural network methods.",

      "abstract": "Innate cortical organisation and postnatal sensory experience interact dynamically to shape the functional architecture of the human brain. Using naturalistic stimulation, functional gradient analyses, and comparative approaches in congenitally blind, congenitally deaf, and typically developed individuals, we investigated how intrinsic hierarchical structures and sensory experiences influence cortical organisation. Our findings demonstrate that the principal functional gradients spanning from unimodal sensory to transmodal association cortices are consistently preserved across all groups, suggesting a robust genetically determined cortical scaffold. Nonetheless, congenital sensory deprivation selectively reshapes the geometry of modality-specific gradients, characterised by reduced functional differentiation within sensory-deprived cortical regions. These geometric contractions promote experience-driven plastic reorganization, enabling deprived sensory areas to establish enhanced functional connectivity with transmodal and non-deprived sensory cortices. Critically, this reorganisation aligns systematically with pre-existing cortical gradients, highlighting intrinsic hierarchical constraints that guide experience-dependent plasticity. Moreover, sensory-deprived regions exhibiting heightened connectivity actively engage in processing structured perceptual information from intact modalities, reflecting specific feature-driven cross-modal adaptations. Collectively, these results underscore a fundamental duality in cortical organisation: innate hierarchical principles impose constraints on cortical architecture, while sensory experience drives adaptive refinement, demonstrating the brain's intrinsic capacity for flexible functional reconfiguration in response to sensory deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Non-coding RNA structure and function are essential to understanding various biological processes, such as cell signaling, gene expression, and post-transcriptional regulations. These are all among the core problems in the RNA field. With the rapid growth of sequencing technology, we have accumulated a massive amount of unannotated RNA sequences. On the other hand, expensive experimental observatory results in only limited numbers of annotated data and 3D structures. Hence, it is still challenging to design computational methods for predicting their structures and functions. The lack of annotated data and systematic study causes inferior performance. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel RNA foundation model (RNA-FM) to take advantage of all the 23 million non-coding RNA sequences through self-supervised learning. Within this approach, we discover that the pre-trained RNA-FM could infer sequential and evolutionary information of non-coding RNAs without using any labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate RNA-FM’s effectiveness by applying it to the downstream secondary/3D structure prediction, SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and evolution prediction, protein-RNA binding preference modeling, and gene expression regulation modeling. The comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method improves the RNA structural and functional modelling results significantly and consistently.

Machine learning can both enable and accelerate discovery, but faces a fundamental hurdle when applied to unseen data with distributions that differ from previously observed ones—a common dilemma in scientific inquiry. We have developed a new deep learning framework, called Portal Learning, to explore dark chemical and biological space. Three key, novel components of our approach include: (i) end-to-end, step-wise transfer learning, in recognition of biology’s sequence-structure-function paradigm, (ii) out-of-cluster meta-learning, and (iii) stress model selection. Portal Learning provides a practical solution to the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in statistical machine learning. Here, we have implemented Portal Learning to predict chemicalprotein interactions on a genome-wide scale. Systematic studies demonstrate that Portal Learning can effectively assign ligands to unexplored gene families (unknown functions), versus existing state-of-the-art methods. Compared with AlphaFold2-based protein-ligand docking, Portal Learning significantly improved the performance by 79% in PR-AUC and 27% in ROC-AUC, respectively. The superior performance of Portal Learning allowed us to target previously “undruggable” proteins and design novel polypharmacological agents for disrupting interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Background  MicroRNAs play a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific target sites within gene transcripts, making the identification of microRNA targets a prominent focus of research. Conventional experimental methods for identifying microRNA targets are both time-consuming and expensive, prompting the development of computational tools for target prediction. However, the existing computational tools exhibit limited performance in meeting the demands of practical applications, highlighting the need to improve the performance of microRNA target prediction models. Results  In this paper, we utilize the most popular natural language processing and computer vision technologies to propose a novel approach, called TEC-miTarget, for microRNA target prediction based on Transformer Encoder and convolutional neural networks. TEC-miTarget treats RNA sequences as a natural language and encodes them using a Transformer Encoder, a widely used encoder in natural language processing. It then combines the representations of a pair of microRNA and its candidate target site sequences into a contact map, which is a three-dimensional array similar to a multi-channel image. Therefore, the contact map's features are extracted using a four-layer convolutional neural network, enabling the prediction of interactions between microRNA and its candidate target sites. We applied a series of comparative experiments to demonstrate that TEC-miTarget significantly improves microRNA target prediction, compared with existing state-of-the-art models. Our approach is the first approach to perform comparisons with other approaches at both sequence and transcript levels. Furthermore, it is the first approach compared with both deep learning-based and seed-match-based methods. We first compared TEC-miTarget’s performance with approaches at the sequence level, and our approach delivers substantial improvements in performance using the same datasets and evaluation metrics. Moreover, we utilized TEC-miTarget to predict microRNA targets in long mRNA sequences, which involves two steps: selecting candidate target site sequences and applying sequence-level predictions. We finally showed that TEC-miTarget outperforms other approaches at the transcript level, including the popular seed match methods widely used in previous years. Conclusions  We propose a novel approach for predicting microRNA targets at both sequence and transcript levels, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods based on deep learning or seed match. We also provide our approach as an easy-to-use software, TEC-miTarget, at https://github.com/tingpeng17/TEC-miTarget. Our results provide new perspectives for microRNA target prediction.</p>",

      "abstract": "Advances in biomedicine are largely fueled by exploring uncharted territories of human biology. Machine learning can both enable and accelerate discovery, but faces a fundamental hurdle when applied to unseen data with distributions that differ from previously observed ones -- a common dilemma in scientific inquiry. We have developed a new deep learning framework, called {\\textit{Portal Learning}}, to explore dark chemical and biological space. Three key, novel components of our approach include: (i) end-to-end, step-wise transfer learning, in recognition of biology's sequence-structure-function paradigm, (ii) out-of-cluster meta-learning, and (iii) stress model selection. Portal Learning provides a practical solution to the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in statistical machine learning. Here, we have implemented Portal Learning to predict chemical-protein interactions on a genome-wide scale. Systematic studies demonstrate that Portal Learning can effectively assign ligands to unexplored gene families (unknown functions), versus existing state-of-the-art methods, thereby allowing us to target previously \"undruggable\" proteins and design novel polypharmacological agents for disrupting interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Portal Learning is general-purpose and can be further applied to other areas of scientific inquiry.",

      "abstract": "The development of stable antibodies formed by compatible heavy (H) and light (L) chain pairs is crucial in both the in vivo maturation of antibody-producing cells and the ex vivo designs of therapeutic antibodies. We present here a novel machine learning framework, ImmunoMatch, for deciphering the molecular rules governing the pairing of antibody chains. Fine-tuned on an antibody-specific language model, ImmunoMatch learns from paired H and L sequences from single human B cells to distinguish cognate H-L pairs and randomly paired sequences. We find that the predictive performance of ImmunoMatch can be augmented by training separate models on the two types of antibody L chains in humans, κ and λ , in line with the in vivo mechanism of B cell development in the bone marrow. Using ImmunoMatch, we illustrate that refinement of H-L chain pairing is a hallmark of B cell maturation in both healthy and disease conditions. We find further that ImmunoMatch is sensitive to sequence differences at the H-L interface. ImmunoMatch focusses on H-L chain pairing as a specific, under-explored problem in antibody developability, and facilitates the computational assessment and modelling of stably assembled immunoglobulins towards large-scale optimisation of efficacious antibody therapeutics.",

      "title": "MutBERT: Probabilistic Genome Representation Improves Genomics Foundation Models",
      "abstract": "<h4>Motivation</h4> Understanding the genomic foundation of human diversity and disease requires models that effectively capture sequence variation, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). While recent genomic foundation models have scaled to larger datasets and multi-species inputs, they often fail to account for the sparsity and redundancy inherent in human population data, such as those in the 1000 Genomes Project. SNPs are rare in humans, and current masked language models (MLMs) trained directly on whole-genome sequences may struggle to efficiently learn these variations. Additionally, training on the entire dataset without prioritizing regions of genetic variation results in inefficiencies and negligible gains in performance. <h4>Results</h4> We present MutBERT, a probabilistic genome-based masked language model that efficiently utilizes SNP information from population-scale genomic data. By representing the entire genome as a probabilistic distribution over observed allele frequencies, MutBERT focuses on informative genomic variations while maintaining computational efficiency. We evaluated MutBERT against DNABERT-2, various versions of Nucleotide Transformer, and modified versions of MutBERT across multiple downstream prediction tasks. MutBERT consistently ranked as one of the top-performing models, demonstrating that this novel representation strategy enables better utilization of biobank-scale genomic data in building pretrained genomic foundation models. <h4>Availability</h4> https://github.com/ai4nucleome/mutBERT <h4>Contact</h4> yanlinzhang@hkust-gz.edu.cn",

A significant portion of these proteins remains functionally uncharacterized, limiting our understanding of bacterial survival mechanisms. Hence, we developed Deep Expression STructure (DeepEST), a multimodal deep learning framework designed to accurately predict protein function in bacteria by assigning Gene Ontology (GO) terms. DeepEST comprises two modules: a multi-layer perceptron that takes gene expression and location as input features, and a protein structure-based predictor. Within DeepEST, we integrated these modules through a learnable weighted linear combination and introduced a novel masked loss function to fine-tune the structure-based predictor for bacterial species. We showed that DeepEST strongly outperforms existing protein function prediction methods relying solely on amino acid sequence or protein structure. Moreover, DeepEST predicts GO terms for unclassified hypothetical proteins across 25 human bacterial pathogens, facilitating the design of experimental setups for characterization studies.",

      "abstract": "Electronic health records, biobanks, and wearable biosensors contain multiple high-dimensional clinical data (HDCD) modalities (e.g., ECG, Photoplethysmography (PPG), and MRI) for each individual. Access to multimodal HDCD provides a unique opportunity for genetic studies of complex traits because different modalities relevant to a single physiological system (e.g., circulatory system) encode complementary and overlapping information. We propose a novel multimodal deep learning method, M-REGLE, for discovering genetic associations from a joint representation of multiple complementary HDCD modalities. We showcase the effectiveness of this model by applying it to several cardiovascular modalities. M-REGLE jointly learns a lower representation (i.e., latent factors) of multimodal HDCD using a convolutional variational autoencoder, performs genome wide association studies (GWAS) on each latent factor, then combines the results to study the genetics of the underlying system. To validate the advantages of M-REGLE and multimodal learning, we apply it to common cardiovascular modalities (PPG and ECG), and compare its results to unimodal learning methods in which representations are learned from each data modality separately, but the downstream genetic analyses are performed on the combined unimodal representations. M-REGLE identifies 19.3% more loci on the 12-lead ECG dataset, 13.0% more loci on the ECG lead I + PPG dataset, and its genetic risk score significantly outperforms the unimodal risk score at predicting cardiac phenotypes, such as atrial fibrillation (Afib), in multiple biobanks.",

We combine the embeddings from LLMs with the raw data under the zero-shot learning framework to further extend its function by using the fine-tuning framework to handle different tasks. We demonstrate that scELMo is capable of cell clustering, batch effect correction, and cell-type annotation without training a new model. Moreover, the fine-tuning framework of scELMo can help with more challenging tasks including in-silico treatment analysis or modeling perturbation. scELMo has a lighter structure and lower requirements for resources. Our method also outperforms recent large-scale FMs (such as scGPT [1], Geneformer [2]) and other LLM-based single-cell data analysis pipelines (such as GenePT [3] and GPTCelltype [4]) based on our evaluations, suggesting a promising path for developing domain-specific FMs.",

Most lack annotation, automated methods are error prone, and few genomes are ever manually curated due to time and cost. Protein structure prediction software may provide new angles for assessing and improving gene models without requiring experimental data. In this paper, we explore whether scores from protein structure prediction can aid in scoring gene model quality. We chose three species (  Fusarium graminearum ,  Toxoplasma gondii , and  Aspergillus fumigatus ) from the VEuPathDB database which have collectively undergone more than 1000 manual curation events. We modelled translations of the gene models with AlphaFold 3, before and after curation, collecting various scores. Then we carried out structure searching of the PDB with Foldseek and sequence-based domain identification using InterProScan. We profiled the scores produced by these methods to identify those best for gene model assessment.  <h4>Results</h4>  AlphaFold 3 scores strongly favoured manually improved over pre-improvement models, supporting 75% of manually-curated changes in  F. graminearum , 65% in  T. gondii , and 84% in  A. fumigatus (the lower percentage in  T. gondii attributed to a high level of disorder). Further, combining scores across multiple tools (AlphaFold 3, Foldseek and InterProScan) provided additional improvements in model scoring.  <h4>Conclusion</h4>  Overall, the most discriminative scores combined outputs of AlphaFold 3 and Foldseek. Our results therefore highlight the potential of scores derived from deep learning-based protein structure prediction for scoring gene models in the absence of experimental data.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Predicting outcomes on human genetic studies is difficult because the number of variables (genes) is often much larger than the number of observations (human subject tissue samples). We investigated means for improving model performance on the types of under-constrained problems that are typical in human genetics, where the number of strongly correlated genes (features) may exceed 10,000, and the number of study participants (observations) may be limited to under 1,000. <h4>Methods</h4> We created ‘train’, ‘validate’ and ‘test’ datasets from 240 microarray observations from 127 subjects diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 113 ‘typically developing’ (TD) subjects. We trained a neural network model (a.k.a., the ‘naive’ model) on 10,422 genes using the ‘train’ dataset, composed of 70 ASD and 65 TD subjects, and we restricted the model to one, fully-connected hidden layer to minimize the number of trainable parameters, including a dropout layer to help prevent overfitting. We experimented with alternative network architectures and tuned the hyperparameters using the ‘validate’ dataset, and performed a single, final evaluation using the holdout ‘test’ dataset. Next, we trained a neural network model using the identical architecture and identical genes to predict tissue type in GTEx data. We transferred that learning by replacing the top layer of the GTEx model with a layer to predict ASD outcome and we retrained the new layer on the ASD dataset, again using the identical 10,422 genes. <h4>Findings</h4> The ‘naive’ neural network model had AUROC=0.58 for the task of predicting ASD outcomes, which saw a statistically significant 7.8% improvement from transfer learning. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We demonstrated that neural network learning could be transferred from models trained on large RNA-Seq gene expression to a model trained on a small, microarray gene expression dataset with clinical utility for mitigating over-training on small sample sizes. Incidentally, we built a highly accurate classifier of tissue type with which to perform the transfer learning. <h4>Funding</h4> This work was supported in part by NIMH R01-MH110558 (E.C., N.E.L.) <h4>Author Summary</h4> Image recognition and natural language processing have enjoyed great success in reusing the computational efforts and data sources to overcome the problem of over-training a neural network on a limited dataset. Other domains using deep learning, including genomics and clinical applications, have been slower to benefit from transfer learning. Here we demonstrate data preparation and modeling techniques that allow genomics researchers to take advantage of transfer learning in order to increase the utility of limited clinical datasets. We show that a non-pre-trained, ‘naive’ model performance can be improved by 7.8% by transferring learning from a highly performant model trained on GTEx data to solve a similar problem.",

Given the sheer magnitude of the collected data and the significant challenges offered by the presence of highly similar genomic structure across species, there is a need for robust, scalable analysis platforms to extract actionable knowledge such as the presence of potentially zoonotic pathogens. The emergence of zoonotic diseases from novel pathogens, such as the influenza virus in 1918 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 that can jump species barriers and lead to pandemic underscores the need for scalable metagenome analysis. In this work, we propose MG2Vec, a deep learning-based solution that uses the transformer network as its backbone, to learn robust features from raw metagenome sequences for downstream biomedical tasks such as targeted and generalized pathogen detection. Extensive experiments on four increasingly challenging, yet realistic diagnostic settings, show that the proposed approach can help detect pathogens from uncurated, real-world clinical samples with minimal human supervision in the form of labels. Further, we demonstrate that the learned representations can generalize to completely unrelated pathogens across diseases and species for large-scale metagenome analysis. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of a novel representation learning framework for metagenome-based disease diagnostics with deep learning and provide a way forward for extracting and using robust vector representations from low-cost next generation sequencing to develop generalizable diagnostic tools.",

      "abstract": "Large language models, trained on enormous corpora of biological sequences, are state-of-the-art for downstream genomic and proteomic tasks. Since the genome contains the information to encode all proteins, genomic language models (gLMs) hold the potential to make downstream predictions not only about DNA sequences, but also about proteins. However, the performance of gLMs on protein tasks remains unknown, due to few tasks pairing proteins with the coding DNA sequences (CDS) that can be processed by gLMs. In this work, we curated five such datasets and used them to evaluate the performance of gLMs and proteomic language models (pLMs). We show that gLMs are competitive and even outperform their pLMs counterparts on some tasks. The best performance was achieved using the retrieved CDS compared to sampling strategies. We found that training a joint genomic-proteomic model outperforms each individual approach, showing that they capture different but complementary sequence representations, as we demonstrate through model interpretation of their embeddings. Lastly, we explored different genomic tokenization schemes to improve downstream protein performance. We trained a new Nucleotide Transformer (50M) foundation model with 3mer tokenization that outperforms its 6mer counterpart on protein tasks while maintaining performance on genomics tasks. The application of gLMs to proteomics offers the potential to leverage rich CDS data, and in the spirit of the central dogma, the possibility of a unified and synergistic approach to genomics and proteomics.

To address the need for reliable risk stratification, we developed cSCCNet, a deep learning model using digital pathology of primary cSCC to predict metastatic risk. A retrospective cohort of 227 primary cSCC is used for model development. cSCCNet automatically selects the tumour area in standard histopathological slides and then stratifies primary cSCC into high- vs. low-risk categories, with heatmaps indicating most predictive tiles contributing to explainability. On a 20% hold-out testing cohort, cSCCNet achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 and 95% accuracy in predicting risk of metastasis, outperforming gene expression-based tools and histopathologic classifications. Multivariate analysis including common clinicopathologic classifications confirm cSCCNet as an independent predictor for metastasis, implying it identifies predictive factors beyond known clinicopathologic risk factors. Histopathological analysis including multiplex immunohistochemistry suggests that tumour differentiation, acantholysis, desmoplasia, and the spatial localisation of lymphocytes relative to tumour tissue are important in predicting risk of developing metastasis. Although further validation including prospective evaluation is required, cSCCNet has potential as a reliable and accurate tool for metastatic risk prediction that could be easily integrated into existing histopathology workflows.</p>",

The next challenge for omics research is how to integrate informations from different omics data using deep learning, so that information from different molecular system levels could be combined to predict the target. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal approach that could efficiently integrate information from different omics data and achieve better accuracy than previous approaches. We evaluate our method in four different tasks: drug repositioning, target gene prediction, breast cancer subtyping and cancer type prediction, and all the four tasks achieved state of art performances. The multimodal approach is implemented in AutoGenome V2 and is also powered with all the previous AutoML convenience to facilitate biomedical researchers.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4> Treatment of severe COVID-19 is currently limited by clinical heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of potentially druggable immune mediators of disease. To advance this, we present a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas in patients with varying COVID-19 severity and compare with influenza, sepsis and healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity revealed cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks as potential therapeutic targets, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Tensor and matrix decomposition of the overall dataset revealed feature groupings linked with disease severity and specificity. Our systems-based integrative approach and blood atlas will inform future drug development, clinical trial design and personalised medicine approaches for COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Gene expression involves transcription and translation. Despite large datasets and increasingly powerful methods devoted to calculating genetic variants' effects on transcription, discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels hinders the systematic interpretation of the regulatory effects of disease-associated variants. Accurate models of the sequence determinants of translation are needed to close this gap and to interpret disease-associated variants that act on translation. Here, we present Translatomer, a multimodal transformer framework that predicts cell-type-specific translation from mRNA expression and gene sequence. We train Translatomer on 33 tissues and cell lines, and show that the inclusion of sequence substantially improves the prediction of ribosome profiling signal, indicating that Translatomer captures sequence-dependent translational regulatory information. Translatomer achieves accuracies of 0.72 to 0.80 for de novo prediction of cell-type-specific ribosome profiling. We develop an in silico mutagenesis tool to estimate mutational effects on translation and demonstrate that variants associated with translation regulation are evolutionarily constrained, both within the human population and across species. Notably, we identify cell-type-specific translational regulatory mechanisms independent of eQTLs for 3,041 non-coding and synonymous variants associated with complex diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and congenital heart disease. Translatomer accurately models the genetic underpinnings of translation, bridging the gap between mRNA and protein levels, and providing valuable mechanistic insights toward mapping \"missing regulation\" in disease genetics.",

      "title": "Robust probabilistic modeling for single-cell multimodal mosaic integration and imputation via scVAEIT",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable joint profiling of multiple omics. These profiles can reveal the complex interplay of different regulatory layers in single cells; still, new challenges arise when integrating datasets with some features shared across experiments and others exclusive to a single source; combining information across these sources is called mosaic integration. The difficulties lie in imputing missing molecular layers to build a self-consistent atlas, finding a common latent space, and transferring learning to new data sources robustly. Existing mosaic integration approaches based on matrix factorization cannot efficiently adapt to nonlinear embeddings for the latent cell space and are not designed for accurate imputation of missing molecular layers. By contrast, we propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model, scVAEIT, to integrate and impute multimodal datasets with mosaic measurements. A key advance is the use of a missing mask for learning the conditional distribution of unobserved modalities and features, which makes scVAEIT flexible to combine different panels of measurements from multimodal datasets accurately and in an end-to-end manner. Imputing the masked features serves as a supervised learning procedure while preventing overfitting by regularization. Focusing on gene expression, protein abundance, and chromatin accessibility, we validate that scVAEIT robustly imputes the missing modalities and features of cells biologically different from the training data. scVAEIT also adjusts for batch effects while maintaining the biological variation, which provides better latent representations for the integrated datasets. We demonstrate that scVAEIT significantly improves integration and imputation across unseen cell types, different technologies, and different tissues. <h4>Significance Statement</h4> Single-cell multimodal assays provide an unprecedented opportunity for investigating heterogeneity of cell types and novel associations with disease and development. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights that cannot be inferred with a single modality, access typically requires the integration of multiple data sources. We propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model for mosaic integration, which involves merging data sources that include features shared across datasets and features exclusive to a single data source. Our model is designed to provide a lower dimensional representation of the cells for visualization, clustering, and other downstream tasks; accurate imputation of missing features and observations; and transfer learning for robustly imputing new datasets when only partial measurements are available.",

      "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation, critical for cellular differentiation and adaptation to environmental changes, involves coordinated interactions among DNA sequences, regulatory proteins, and chromatin architecture. Despite extensive data from consortia like ENCODE, understanding the dynamics of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in gene expression remains challenging. Deep learning is a powerful tool for learning gene expression and epigenomic signals from DNA sequences, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional machine learning approaches. However, even the most advanced deep learning-based methods may fall short in capturing the regulatory effects of distal elements such as enhancers, limiting their predictive accuracy. In addition, these methods may require significant resources to train or to adapt to newly generated data. To address these challenges, we present EPInformer, a scalable deep-learning framework for predicting gene expression by integrating promoter-enhancer interactions with their sequences, epigenomic signals, and chromatin contacts.

      "title": "Transformer with Convolution and Graph-Node co-embedding: An accurate and interpretable vision backbone for predicting gene expressions from local histopathological image",
      "abstract": "Inferring gene expressions from histopathological images has always been a fascinating but challenging task due to the huge differences between the two modal data. Previous works have used modified DenseNet121 to encode the local images and make gene expression predictions. And later works improved the prediction accuracy of gene expression by incorporating the coordinate information from images and using all spots in the tissue region as input. While these methods were limited in use due to model complexity, large demand on GPU memory, and insufficient encoding of local images, thus the results had low interpretability, relatively low accuracy, and over-smooth prediction of gene expression among neighbor spots. In this paper, we propose TCGN, (Transformer with Convolution and Graph-Node co-embedding method) for gene expression prediction from H&E stained pathological slide images. TCGN consists of convolutional layers, transformer encoders, and graph neural networks, and is the first to integrate these blocks in a general and interpretable computer vision backbone for histopathological image analysis. We trained TCGN and compared its performance with three existing methods on a publicly available spatial transcriptomic dataset. Even in the absence of the coordinates information and neighbor spots, TCGN still outperformed the existing methods by 5% and achieved 10 times higher prediction accuracy than the counterpart model. Besides its higher accuracy, our model is also small enough to be run on a personal computer and does not need complex building graph preprocessing compared to the existing methods. Moreover, TCGN is interpretable in recognizing special cell morphology and cell-cell interactions compared to models using all spots as input that are not interpretable. A more accurate omics information prediction from pathological images not only links genotypes to phenotypes so that we can predict more biomarkers that are expensive to test from histopathological images that are low-cost to obtain, but also provides a theoretical basis for future modeling of multi-modal data. Our results support that TCGN is a useful tool for inferring gene expressions from histopathological images and other potential histopathological image analysis studies. <h4>Highlights</h4> First deep learning model to integrate CNN, GNN, and transformer for image analysis An interpretable model that uses cell morphology and organizations to predict genes Higher gene expression prediction accuracy without global information Accurately predicted genes are related to immune escape and abnormal metabolism Predict important biomarkers for breast cancer accurately from cheaper images <h4>Graphical abstract</h4>",

One of the major challenges to understanding the role of condensates is the lack of technologies to map condensate-scale protein architecture at subcompartmental or nanoscale resolution. To address this, we introduce HCR-Proxy, a proximity labelling technique that couples Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)-based signal amplification with in situ proximity biotinylation (Proxy), enabling proteomic profiling of RNA-proximal proteomes at subcompartmental resolution. We benchmarked HCR-Proxy using nascent pre-rRNA targets to investigate the distinct proteomic signatures of the nucleolar subcompartments and to uncover a spatial logic of protein partitioning shaped by RNA sequence. Our results demonstrate HCR-Proxy’s ability to provide spatially-resolved maps of RNA interactomes within the nucleolus, offering new insights into the molecular organisation and compartmentalisation of condensates. This subcompartment-specific nucleolar proteome profiling enabled integration with deep learning frameworks, which effectively confirmed a sequence-encoded basis for protein partitioning across nested condensate subcompartments, characterised by antagonistic gradients in charge, length, and RNA-binding domains. HCR-Proxy thus provides a scalable platform for spatially resolved RNA interactome discovery, bridging transcript localisation with proteomic context in native cellular environments. <h4>GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Bullet points</h4> - HCR-Proxy enables the first nanoscale-resolution mapping of RNA-proximal proteomes in situ . - HCR-Proxy establishes a broadly applicable modular platform for spatially resolved RNA– interactomics. - Subcompartmental proteomes are resolved across nucleolar subdomains by targeting specific pre-rRNA regions. - Deep learning confirms a sequence-encoded logic of protein partitioning within condensate subcompartments.",

However, the genetic events responsible for introducing these sex-specific features remain poorly understood. In this study, we created a comprehensive gene expression atlas for both sexes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans across development. By comparing the transcriptome of pure populations of hermaphrodites and males from early larval stages to adulthood, we discovered numerous differentially expressed genes, including neuronal gene families like transcription factors, neuropeptides, and GPCRs. We identified INS-39, an insulin-like peptide, as a prominent male-biased gene expressed specifically in ciliated sensory neurons. We show that INS-39 serves as an early-stage male marker, facilitating the effective isolation of males in high-throughput experiments. Through complex and sex-specific regulation, ins-39 plays pleiotropic sexually-dimorphic roles in temperature sensation, survival in cold temperatures, resilience against high hydrogen peroxide levels, and dauer entry, while also playing a shared, dimorphic role in early life stress. This study offers a comparative sexual and developmental gene expression database for C. elegans , which will facilitate research into the genetic regulation of the sexual development of other organisms. Furthermore, it highlights conserved candidate genes that may underlie the sexually-dimorphic manifestation of different human diseases.",

Particularly, NeuroTD integrates Siamese neural networks with frequency domain transformations and complex value optimization for inference. We applied NeuroTD to three multimodal datasets to (1) analyze electrophysiological (ephys) time series measured by depth electrodes, identifying time delays among neurons across various positions, (2) investigate neural activity and behavioral time series data derived from Neuropixels and 3D motion captures, establishing causal relationships between neural activities and corresponding behavioral activities, and (3) explore gene expression and ephys data of single neurons from Patch-seq, identifying gene expression signatures highly correlated with time shifts in ephys responses.

      "abstract": "T-cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system by inducing an anti-tumour response, defending against pathogens, and maintaining tolerance against self-antigens, which has sparked interest in the development of T-cell-based vaccines and immunotherapies. Because screening antigens driving the T-cell response is currently low-throughput and laborious, computational methods for predicting CD8+ T-cell epitopes have emerged. However, most immunogenicity algorithms struggle to learn features of peptide immunogenicity from small datasets, suffer from HLA bias and are unable to reliably predict pathology-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes. Therefore, we developed TRAP (T-cell recognition potential of HLA-I presented peptides), a robust deep learning platform for predicting CD8+ T-cell epitopes from MHC-I presented pathogenic and self-peptides. TRAP uses transfer learning, deep learning architecture and MHC binding information to make context-specific predictions of CD8+ T-cell epitopes. TRAP also detects low-confidence predictions for peptides that differ significantly from those in the training datasets to abstain from making incorrect predictions. To estimate the immunogenicity of pathogenic peptides with low-confidence predictions, we further developed a novel metric, RSAT (relative similarity to autoantigens and tumour-associated antigens), as a complementary to ‘dissimilarity to self’ from cancer studies. We used TRAP to identify epitopes from glioblastoma patients as well as SARS-CoV-2 peptides, and it outperformed other algorithms in both cancer and pathogenic settings. Thus, this study presents a novel computational platform for accurately predicting CD8+ T-cell epitopes to foster a better understanding of antigen-specific T-cell response and the development of effective clinical therapeutics. <h4>Highlights</h4> HLA bias and out-of-distribution problem are causes of poor performance of current state-of-the-art algorithms Transfer learning, deep learning architecture, context-specific and HLA-generalised approaches improve CD8+ T-cell epitope prediction TRAP reports degree of correctness to improve reliability of the prediction A novel metric termed RSAT estimates immunogenicity of pathogenic peptides, as a complementary to ‘dissimilarity to self’ from cancer studies",

      "abstract": "The unprecedented and overwhelming SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease significantly challenged our way of life, society and the economy. Many questions emerge, a critical one being how to quantify the challenges, realities, intervention effect and influence of the pandemic. With the massive effort that has been in relation to modeling COVID-19, what COVID-19 issues have been modeled? What and how well have epidemiology, AI, data science, machine learning, deep learning, mathematics and social science characterized the COVID-19 epidemic? what are the gaps and opportunities of quantifying the pandemic? Such questions involve a wide body of knowledge and literature, which are unclear but important for present and future health crisis quantification. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the challenges, tasks, methods, progress, gaps and opportunities in relation to modeling COVID-19 processes, data, mitigation and impact. With a research landscape of COVID-19 modeling, we further categorize, summarize, compare and discuss the related methods and the progress which has been made in modeling COVID-19 epidemic transmission processes and dynamics, case identification and tracing, infection diagnosis and medical treatments, non-pharmaceutical interventions and their effects, drug and vaccine development, psychological, economic and social influence and impact, and misinformation, etc. The review shows how modeling methods such as mathematical and statistical models, domain-driven modeling by epidemiological compartmental models, medical and biomedical analysis, AI and data science, in particular shallow and deep machine learning, simulation modeling, social science methods and hybrid modeling have addressed the COVID-19 challenges, what gaps exist and what research directions can be followed for a better future.",

      "title": "Advances in Image Processing and Pattern Recognition in Cancer Detection, Prediction, Diagnosis, and Prognosis",
      "abstract": "Cancer remains a global health issue, with early detection, correct diagnosis, and exact prognosis playing critical roles in improving patient outcomes. Recent developments in image processing and pattern recognition have significantly enhanced cancer detection, prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis, bridging the gap between conventional radiological methods and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)-based analytics. The abstract provides an in-depth introduction of the concepts behind, developing methods, and practical applications of image processing and pattern recognition in oncology. Image preprocessing algorithms, tumor segmentation algorithms, feature extraction, and pattern recognition methods based on artificial intelligence such as machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, and transformers) are all significant areas. We study cancer prediction using radiomics and radio genomics, artificial intelligence-based histopathological diagnosis, and fusion of multimodal data from imaging, genomics, and clinical history for personalized prognosis. The impact of explainable AI, 3D/4D imaging, nanotechnology-facilitated imaging, and cloud-based AI solutions is also discussed, including precision oncology and remote diagnosis. Even with these developments, significant clinical use limitations remain, such as poor annotated datasets, lack of interpretability, ethical considerations, and regulatory issues. The abstract proceeds with focusing on emerging trends, including federated learning, quantum computing, and real-time AI applications, that can potentially revolutionize cancer imaging and management. Image processing and pattern recognition, if integrated with interdisciplinary research, have the potential to develop more precise, equitable, and egalitarian cancer care in the future.",

      "abstract": "Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) provides promising avenues to augment histopathological investigation with rich spatio-molecular information. We have previously developed a classification model to differentiate melanoma from nevi lesions based on IMS protein data, a task that is challenging solely by histopathologic evaluation. Most IMS-focused studies collect microscopy in tandem with IMS data, but this microscopy data is generally omitted in downstream data analysis. Microscopy, nevertheless, forms the basis for traditional histopathology and thus contains invaluable morphological information. In this work, we developed a multimodal classification pipeline that uses deep learning, in the form of a pre-trained artificial neural network, to extract the meaningful morphological features from histopathological images, and combine it with the IMS data. To test whether this deep learning-based classification strategy can improve on our previous results in classification of melanocytic neoplasia, we utilized MALDI IMS data with collected serial H&E stained sections for 331 patients, and compared this multimodal classification pipeline to classifiers using either exclusively microscopy or IMS data. The multimodal pipeline achieved the best performance, with ROC-AUCs of 0.968 vs. 0.938 vs. 0.931 for the multimodal, unimodal microscopy and unimodal IMS pipelines respectively. Due to the use of a pre-trained network to perform the morphological feature extraction, this pipeline does not require any training on large amounts of microscopy data. As such, this framework can be readily applied to improve classification performance in other experimental settings where microscopy data is acquired in tandem with IMS experiments.",

Therefore, understanding these interactions is vital for both functional genomics and drug discovery efforts. Despite a significant increase in the availability of protein-peptide complexes, experimental methods for studying these interactions remain laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Computational methods offer a complementary approach but often fall short in terms of prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce PepCNN, a deep learning-based prediction model that incorporates structural and sequence-based information from primary protein sequences. By utilizing a combination of half-sphere exposure, position specific scoring matrices, and pre-trained transformer language model, PepCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of specificity, precision, and AUC.

      "abstract": "Image-based profiling of the cellular response to drug compounds has proven to be an effective method to characterize the morphological changes resulting from chemical perturbation experiments. This approach has been useful in the field of drug discovery, ranging from phenotype-based screening to identifying a compound’s mechanism of action or toxicity. As a greater amount of data becomes available however, there are growing demands for deep learning methods to be applied to perturbation data. In this paper we applied the transformer-based SwinV2 computer vision architecture to predict the mechanism of action of 10 kinase inhibitor compounds directly from raw images of the cellular response. This method outperforms the standard approach of using image-based profiles, multidimensional feature set representations generated by bioimaging software. Furthermore, we combined the best performing models for three different data modalities, raw images, image-based profiles and compound chemical structures, to form a fusion model, Cell-Vision Fusion (CVF). This approach classified the kinase inhibitors with 69.79% accuracy and 70.56% F1 score, 4.20% and 5.49% greater, respectively, than the best performing image-based profile method. Our work provides three techniques, specific to Cell Painting images, which enable the SwinV2 architecture to train effectively, and explores approaches to combat the significant batch effects present in large Cell Painting perturbation datasets.",

      "abstract": "The genome, which serves as the inherent language directing the blueprint of life, offers significant analysis prospects by combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Integrating biological sequences with other digital healthcare information has potential to transform data-driven diagnostics. Large language models (LLMs) can be harnessed to decode the genomic language. This endeavor encounters three critical challenges: First, long biomolecular sequences require segmentation into smaller subunits, which is non-trivial since many biological “words” remain unknown. Second, the analysis of extended DNA sequences using LLMs demands a compute-intensive infrastructure. Third, ensuring reproducibility and reusability of modeling workflows remains an unresolved issue. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an empirical DNA tokenisation approach and a versatile, semantic-aware, genome language model — genomicBERT . The model is species-agnostic and operates seamlessly at the DNA or RNA levels. By introducing a reduced and specialized DNA vocabulary, our approach minimizes computational overhead and optimizes performance. Our benchmarking demonstrates that the genomicBERT matches or surpasses the performance of contemporary tools on the same datasets under different experimental conditions. To encourage collaboration and ease of access, we introduce genomicBERT as an integral component of the openly accessible conda package, genomeNLP . Validated across diverse case studies, genomicBERT lowers the barriers to decoding genomic language, relying solely on sequence data to extract meaningful insights. <h4>Highlights</h4>  This novel model offers a compelling solution for DNA sequence analysis by significantly reducing model size and computational costs without compromising performance, setting a new standard for efficient model development. We demonstrate that a powerful vocabulary and tokenization method helps to derive patterns from biological sequence data while accounting for hidden semantic rules. Our method is agnostic to species or biomolecule type as it is data-driven. Hence, it can be applied to DNA and RNA We validate the important genomicBERT tokens by mapping back to the biologically significant motifs. We present a publicly available genome language modeling toolkit called genomeNLP , specifically designed to combine computational linguistics and genomics, enabling researchers from biology backgrounds to analyze and interpret genomic sequences effectively.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Somatic copy number alterations drive aberrant gene expression in cancer cells. In tumors with high levels of chromosomal instability, subclonal copy number alterations (CNAs) are a prevalent feature which often result in heterogeneous cancer cell populations with distinct phenotypes 1 . However, the extent to which subclonal CNAs contribute to clone-specific phenotypes remains poorly understood, in part due to the lack of methods to quantify how CNAs influence gene expression at a subclone level. We developed TreeAlign, which computationally integrates independently sampled single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing data from the same cell population and explicitly models gene dosage effects from subclonal alterations. We show through quantitative benchmarking data and application to human cancer data with single cell DNA and RNA libraries that TreeAlign accurately encodes clone-specific transcriptional effects of subclonal CNAs, the impact of allelic imbalance on allele-specific transcription, and obviates the need to arbitrarily define genotypic clones from a phylogenetic tree a priori . Combined, these advances lead to highly granular definitions of clones with distinct copy-number driven expression programs with increased resolution and accuracy over competing methods. The resulting improvement in assignment of transcriptional phenotypes to genomic clones enables clone-clone gene expression comparisons and explicit inference of genes that are mechanistically altered through CNAs, and identification of expression programs that are genomically independent. Our approach sets the stage for dissecting the relative contribution of fixed genomic alterations and dynamic epigenetic processes on gene expression programs in cancer.",

      "abstract": "One of the primary tasks in vaccine design and development of immunotherapeutic drugs is to predict conformational B-cell epitopes corresponding to primary antibody binding sites within the antigen tertiary structure. To date, multiple approaches have been developed to address this issue. However, for a wide range of antigens their accuracy is limited. In this paper, we applied the transfer learning approach using pretrained deep learning models to develop a model that predicts conformational B-cell epitopes based on the primary antigen sequence and tertiary structure. A pretrained protein language model, ESM-1b, and an inverse folding model, ESM-IF1, were fine-tuned to quantitatively predict antibody-antigen interaction features and distinguish between epitope and non-epitope residues. The resulting model called SEMA demonstrated the best performance on an independent test set with ROC AUC of 0.76 compared to peer-reviewed tools. We show that SEMA can quantitatively rank the immunodominant regions within the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2.

Design  Cross-sectional online survey with prespecified outcomes. Setting  United Kingdom; data collected online 3 October-7 November 2025. Participants  A community sample of 1,468 adults (mean age 44.8 year; 49.8% female). Prior AI use was common (79.4%). eHealth literacy was measured using eight-item eHEALS scale (α = 0.91). Main outcome measures  Primary outcome was trust in AI-assisted clinical decision-making (5-point-scale). Secondary outcomes included the within-person trust gap between AI-assisted and AI-only decisions, governance preferences, accountability for AI-related harm, and trust in regulators and developers. Results  Trust was strongly contingent on human oversight. High trust was reported by 62.7% for AI-assisted decisions (mean 3.63, SD 0.95) but by only 10.5% for AI-only decisions (mean 2.15, SD 1.01), yielding a mean within-person trust gap of 1.47 points. Almost all participants (95.2%) preferred a health and care professional as the final decision-maker. Support for governance was high: 92.2% wanted disclosure whenever AI is used, 83.4% opposed unsupervised AI advice, and 79.4% supported stronger regulation. Higher trust in AI-assisted decisions was independently associated with prior AI use, higher eHealth literacy and older age. Conclusions  Public confidence in healthcare AI is conditional. Trust is higher when clinicians retain accountability, AI use is transparently disclosed, and performance claims are evidence-based, underscoring the need to embed disclosure, human oversight and robust governance in AI/SaMD deployment.</p>",

      "abstract": "The rise of single-cell atlases has opened up the use of reference atlases as a comprehensive healthy control for the study of disease. A key step for using atlases is the mapping of “query” disease or perturbed datasets onto a healthy reference atlas, which allows for comparison of the query to healthy controls and thereby the identification of perturbation-specific transcriptional cell states. However, the mapping success, i.e. the extent to which these mappings correctly reflect biological similarities and differences between query and reference, varies with e.g. experimental confounders in the data (dissociation protocol, single-cell assay) or the mapping method used, and cannot be predicted in advance. Moreover, an unsuccessful mapping can result in falsely reporting technical artifacts as disease or perturbation-specific cellular changes and in overlooking true altered states. Here, we present MapQC, a method that quantifies query-to-reference mapping success by leveraging the information present in the reference embedding. Specifically, MapQC tests the presence of remaining batch effect in the embedding after mapping by comparing inter-sample distances in the healthy reference itself to distance of query control samples to the reference. Similarly, it tests whether disease or perturbation-specific variation has been retained during mapping by testing whether query perturbed samples are more distant to the reference than reference samples are from each other. We apply MapQC to lung and endometrial query datasets, including data of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Asherman Syndrome, mapped to large-scale healthy references. We show that MapQC correctly distinguishes successful mappings from unsuccessful ones where data visualization techniques such as UMAP can be deceiving, and that mapQC outperforms integration metrics often re-purposed for mapping qualitycontrol. Moreover, only mappings that MapQC identified as successful result in the correct identification of cell state changes specific to disease. Taken together, MapQC provides a critical quality-control metric for a more reliable, robust, and accurate use of reference atlases to study disease.",

Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to enhance the prediction of recovery trajectories, but its integration into clinical practice requires a thorough understanding of its efficacy and applicability. We systematically reviewed the current literature on data-driven models of SCI recovery prediction. The included studies were evaluated based on a range of criteria assessing the approach, implementation, input data preferences, and the clinical outcomes aimed to forecast. We observe a tendency to utilize routinely acquired data, such as International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI), imaging, and demographics, for the prediction of functional outcomes derived from the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores with a focus on motor ability. Although there has been an increasing interest in data-driven studies over time, traditional machine learning architectures, such as linear regression and tree-based approaches, remained the overwhelmingly popular choices for implementation. This implies ample opportunities for exploring architectures addressing the challenges of predicting SCI recovery, including techniques for learning from limited longitudinal data, improving generalizability, and enhancing reproducibility. We conclude with a perspective, highlighting possible future directions for data-driven SCI recovery prediction and drawing parallels to other application fields in terms of diverse data types (imaging, tabular, sequential, multimodal), data challenges (limited, missing, longitudinal data), and algorithmic needs (causal inference, robustness).",

However, MTI platforms face challenges such as high costs, tissue loss, lengthy acquisition times, and complex analysis of large, multichannel images with batch effects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel computational method to model the interactions between dozens of panel markers and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining, enabling in-silico generation of marker stains. This approach reduces the reliance on experimentally measured markers, bridging low-cost H&E data with MTI’s high-content information. Our approach uses a two-stage frame-work for channel-wise bioimage synthesis: first, vector quantization learns a visual token vocabulary, then a bidirectional transformer infers missing markers through masked language modeling. Comprehensive bench-marking across different MTI platforms and tissue types demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in improving marker prediction while maintaining biological relevance.

Objective  To identify distinct phenotypic subsets of RA patients based on baseline clinical data, in order to advance understanding of disease etiology and treatment strategies. Methods  We collected hematological, serological, and clinical data from RA-patients in the Leiden Rheumatology clinic(n = 1,387), and combined multimodal deep learning techniques with clustering to identify phenotypically distinct RA subsets. These clusters were tested for associations in clinical outcomes. Findings were replicated in clinical trial data (n = 307) and independent secondary care (9 clinics, n = 515), and further explored for histological differences in synovial tissue (n = 194). Results  Four distinct RA subsets with different Joint Involvement Patterns (JIP), emerged: 1) foot-predominant arthritis, 2) seropositive oligoarticular disease, 3) seronegative hand arthritis, and 4) polyarthritis. We found high cluster stability, no physician influence, significant difference in remission rates  <italic>(P</italic>   = 0.007) and methotrexate failure (  <italic>P</italic>   < 0.001) in initial and replication sets.

Synovial histology showed both JIP-poly and JIP-hand had increased synovial lining and inflammatory infiltrate, with JIP-hand showing notably high stromal density. JIP-feet scored evenly across categories without standing out, while JIP-oligo had lower synovitis degree. Conclusions  We identified and validated four distinct RA phenotypes characterized by joint involvement patterns, which associate with treatment outcomes and synovial histology.

      "title": "Multimodal data fusion of adult and pediatric brain tumors with deep learning",
      "abstract": "The introduction of deep learning in both imaging and genomics has significantly advanced the analysis of biomedical data. For complex diseases such as cancer different data modalities may reveal different disease characteristics, and the integration of imaging with genomic data has the potential to unravel additional information then when using these data sources in isolation. Here, we propose a DL framework that by combining histopathology images with gene expression profiles can predict prognosis of brain tumors. Using two separate cohorts of 783 adult and 305 pediatric brain tumors, the developed multimodal data models achieved better prediction results compared to the single data models, but also leads to the identification of more relevant biological pathways. Importantly, when testing our adult models on a third independent brain tumor dataset, we show our multimodal framework is able to generalize and performs better on new data from different cohorts. Furthermore, leveraging the concept of transfer learning, we demonstrate how our multimodal models pre-trained on pediatric glioma can be used to predict prognosis for two more rare (less available samples) pediatric brain tumors, i.e. ependymoma and medulloblastoma. To summarize, our study illustrates that a multimodal data fusion approach can be successfully implemented and customized to model clinical outcome of adult and pediatric brain tumors.",

      "title": "BioToken and BioFM – Biologically-Informed Tokenization Enables Accurate and Efficient Genomic Foundation Models",
      "abstract": "Genomic variation underlies human phenotypic diversity, disease susceptibility, and evolutionary adaptation. Although large-scale genomic sequencing has transformed our ability to map genetic variation, accurately modeling and interpreting this data remains a central challenge; while genomic foundation models (GFMs) are a promising approach, they suffer from fundamental limitations. Current GFMs typically treat DNA simplistically as nucleotide-only sequences, overlooking critical biological context, such as genomic annotations, regulatory elements, and functional contexts central to genomic interpretation. Here, we introduce BioToken, a modular and extendable tokenization framework designed to encode genomic variants and biologically relevant region annotations directly into genomic representations. By utilizing intrinsic inductive biases, BioToken facilitates meaningful representation learning and generalization across diverse molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, alternative splicing, and variant pathogenicity prediction. Built on BioToken, our genomic foundation model, BioFM, achieves competitive or superior results relative to specialized models (e.g., Enformer, SpliceTransformer) and GFMs up to 7B parameters across a comprehensive suite of genomic benchmarks, including noncoding pathogenicity, expression modulation, sQTL prediction, and long-range genomic interactions. Notably, BioFM achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters (265M), substantially reducing training costs and computational requirements. Our findings highlight the substantial advantages of integrating biologically-informed inductive biases into genomic foundation modeling, providing a robust and accessible path forward in genomics. We provide our code and model checkpoints to support further research in this direction.",

Using our newly designed software we streamline mapping of high-resolution optical imaging onto reference maps using blood vessels as endogenous fiducial marks.

Natural language processing (NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language, can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition, literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and misinformation detection.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have led to the identification of a vast number of hypothetical proteins, surpassing current experimental capabilities for annotation. Enzymes, crucial for diverse biological functions, have garnered significant attention; however, accurately predicting enzyme EC numbers for proteins with unknown functions remains challenging. Here, we introduce FEDKEA, a novel computational method that integrates ESM-2 and distance-weighted KNN (k-nearest neighbor) to enhance enzyme function annotation. FEDKEA first employs a fine-tuned ESM-2 model with four fully connected layers to distinguish from other proteins. For predicting EC numbers, it adopts a hierarchical approach, utilizing distinct models and training strategies across the four EC number levels. Specifically, the classification of the first EC number level utilizes a fine-tuned ESM-2 model with three fully connected layers, while transfer learning with embeddings from this model supports the second and third-level tasks. The fourth-level classification employs a distance-weighted KNN model. Compared to existing tools such as CLEAN and ECRECer, two state-of-the-art computational methods, FEDKEA demonstrates superior performance. We anticipate that FEDKEA will significantly advance the prediction of enzyme functions for uncharacterized proteins, thereby impacting fields such as genomics, physiology and medicine.

The pseudocell generation strategy of scMM compensates for the limited interpretability of deep learning models and discovered multimodal regulatory programs associated with latent dimensions. Analysis of recently produced datasets validated that scMM facilitates high-resolution clustering with rich interpretability.

We used both interaction and sex-stratified analyses in disease association and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including the X chromosome. Our analyses revealed sex-specific differences in associations between retinal traits, cardiometabolic risk factors, and disease outcomes. Several phenotypes showed prognostic value for mortality and cardiovascular endpoints, predominantly in one sex, illustrating the limitations of sex-agnostic analyses. Genetic analyses revealed differences in genetic architectures, with females exhibiting higher heritability and a greater number of associated loci, as well as sex-specific trait-gene associations. Notably, we report the first genetic association on the X chromosome for retinal vascular phenotypes. These findings suggest sex-differential genetic and environmental contributions to microvascular morphology, possibly reflecting divergent biological pathways and risk profiles.

Analyses across timescales reveal task-dependent advantages of modeling more recent versus deeper evolution. To demonstrate its potential to advance human genetics, we show that GPN-Star substantially outperforms prior methods in prioritizing pathogenic and fine-mapped GWAS variants; yields unprecedented enrichments of complex trait heritability; and improves power in rare variant association testing. Extending beyond humans, we train GPN-Star for five model organisms – Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans , and Arabidopsis thaliana – demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the framework.

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4> Prediction and understanding of tissue-specific virus-host interactions have relevance for the development of novel therapeutic interventions strategies. In addition, virus-like particles (VLPs) open novel opportunities to deliver therapeutic compounds to targeted cell types and tissues. Given our incomplete knowledge of virus-host interactions on one hand and the cost and time associated with experimental procedures on the other, we here propose a novel deep learning approach to predict virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Our method (Siamese Tailored deep sequence Embedding of Proteins - STEP) is based on recent deep protein sequence embedding techniques, which we integrate into a Siamese neural network architecture. After evaluating the high prediction performance of STEP in comparison to an existing method, we apply it to two use cases, SARS-CoV-2 and John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), to predict virus protein to human host interactions. For the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein our method predicts an interaction with the sigma 2 receptor, which has been suggested as a drug target. As a second use case, we apply STEP to predict interactions of the JCV VP1 protein showing an enrichment of PPIs with neurotransmitters, which are known to function as an entry point of the virus into glial brain cells. In both cases we demonstrate how recent techniques from the field of Explainable AI (XAI) can be employed to identify those parts of a pair of sequences, which most likely contribute to the protein-protein interaction. Altogether our work highlights the potential of deep sequence embedding techniques originating from the field of natural language processing as well as XAI methods for the analysis of biological sequences. We have made our method publicly available via GitHub. <h4>The bigger picture</h4> Development of novel cell and tissue specific therapies requires a profound knowledge about protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Identifying these PPIs with experimental approaches such as biochemical assays or yeast two-hybrid screens is cumbersome, costly, and at the same time difficult to scale. Computational approaches can help to prioritize huge amounts of possible PPIs by learning from biological sequences plus already-known PPIs. In this work, we developed a novel approach (Siamese Tailored deep sequence Embedding of Proteins - STEP) that is based on recent deep protein sequence embedding techniques, which we integrate into a Siamese neural network architecture. We use this approach to train models by utilizing protein sequence information and known PPIs. After evaluating the high prediction performance of STEP in comparison to an existing method, we apply it to two use cases, SARS-CoV-2 and John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), to predict virus protein to human host interactions.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Influenza viruses evolve their antigenic phenotype in response to immune-driven selection, necessitating regular updates to the antigens used in influenza vaccines. Characterising antigenic change of influenza virus currently requires intensive serology-based laboratory work to analyse the movements of viruses in antigenic space. By contrast, pathogen genomics can generate large numbers of sequences in near real-time. However, using genetic sequences to predict antigenic changes remains challenging due to the complex relationship between genetic and antigenic changes. Here we develop a deep learning approach to predict the antigenic distance between influenza H3N2 viruses using 83,145 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. We first train an elementary protein language model to encode the HA sequences, and then couple the trained language model with a deep regression model to realise the sequence-based prediction. Our method provides stable and accurate prediction on the antigenic distance between H3N2 viruses using their HA sequences. This facilitates the prediction of antigenic movements of viruses in each influenza season using their sequence data. Our sequence-based method will enable real-time prediction of influenza antigenic changes and support vaccine strain selection.</p>",

Using tissue-specific 5hmC sequencing data, we introduce Deep5hmC, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates both the DNA sequence and the histone modification information to predict genome-wide 5hmC modification. The multimodal design of Deep5hmC demonstrates remarkable improvement in predicting both qualitative and quantitative 5hmC modification compared to unimodal versions of Deep5hmC and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This improvement is demonstrated through benchmarking on a comprehensive set of 5hmC sequencing data collected at four time points during forebrain organoid development and across 17 human tissues. Notably, Deep5hmC showcases its practical utility by accurately predicting gene expression and identifying differentially hydroxymethylated regions in a case-control study of Alzheimer’s disease.",

      "abstract": "DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play critical roles in gene regulation, development, and environmental response across various species, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. While various machine learning and deep learning models have been developed to distinguish DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) from non-DNA-binding proteins (NDBPs), most available tools have focused on human and mouse datasets. As a result, there are limited studies specifically addressing plant-based DNA-binding proteins, which restricts our understanding of their unique roles and functions in plant biology. Developing an efficient framework for improving DBP prediction in plants would enhance our knowledge and enable precise gene expression control, accelerate crop improvement, enhance stress resilience, and optimize metabolic engineering for agricultural advancement. In this work, we developed a tool that uses a protein language model (pLM) pre-trained on millions of sequences. We evaluated several leading models, including ProtT5, Ankh, and ESM-2, and leveraged their high-dimensional, information-rich representations to improve the accuracy of DNA-binding protein prediction in plants significantly. Our final model, pLM-DBPs, a feed-forward neural network classifier utilizing ProtT5-based representations, outperformed existing approaches with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 83.8% on the independent test set. This represents a 10% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model for plant-based DBP prediction, highlighting its superior performance compared to the existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "In the recent years and due to COVID-19 pandemic, drug repurposing or repositioning has been placed in the spotlight. Giving new therapeutic uses to already existing drugs, this discipline allows to streamline the drug discovery process, reducing the costs and risks inherent to de novo development. Computational approaches have gained momentum, and emerging techniques from the machine learning domain have proved themselves as highly exploitable means for repurposing prediction. Against this backdrop, one can find that biomedical data can be represented in terms of graphs, which allow depicting in a very expressive manner the underlying structure of the information. Combining these graph data structures with deep learning models enhances the prediction of new links, such as potential disease-drug connections. In this paper, we present a new model named REDIRECTION, which aim is to predict new disease-drug links in the context of drug repurposing. It has been trained with a part of the DISNET biomedical graph, formed by diseases, symptoms, drugs, and their relationships. The reserved testing graph for the evaluation has yielded to an AUROC of 0.93 and an AUPRC of 0.90. We have performed a secondary validation of REDIRECTION using RepoDB data as the testing set, which has led to an AUROC of 0.87 and a AUPRC of 0.83. In the light of these results, we believe that REDIRECTION can be a meaningful and promising tool to generate drug repurposing hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Cancer immunotherapies for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) continue to lag behind other solid cancer types with the exception of 4% of patients with microsatellite-instable tumors. Thus, there is an urgent need to broaden the clinical benefit of checkpoint blockers to CRC by combining conventional therapies to sensitise tumors to immunotherapy. However, the impact of conventional drugs on immunoediting, potentially promoting the positive selection of less immunogenic variants, and on the tumor immune contexture in CRC, remain elusive. <h4>Methods</h4> We performed comprehensive multimodal profiling using longitudinal samples from metastatic CRC patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy with mFOLFOX6 and Bevacizumab. Exome-sequencing, RNA-sequencing and multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging was carried out on tumor samples obtained before and after therapy and the data was analysed using established methods. The results of the analysis were extrapolated to publicly available datasets (TCGA and CPTAC). In order to identify a surrogate marker, an explainable artificial intelligence method was developed using a transformer-based analytical pipeline for the identification of features in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images associated with specific biological processes, followed by manual evaluation of highly informative tiles by a pathologist. <h4>Results</h4> Mutational profiles were highly modified and the level of genetic intertumoral heterogeneity between patients varied following treatment. Evolutionary analysis indicated eradication of some clones and dominant clonal prevalence of others, supporting the notion of pharmacologically-induced cancer immunoeditin. Post treatment samples showed upregulation of HLA class II genes, activation of differentiation and stemness pathways, and changes in the consensus molecular subtypes. The tumor immune contexture was characterised by increased densities of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, but reduced T cell-tumor cell interactions (and increased T cell exhaustion. The AI-guided analyses of the H&E images pinpointed extracellular mucin deposits associated with stemness genes, suggesting a surrogate marker for routine pathological evaluation. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Conventional therapy induces immunoediting and modulates the immune contexture in metastatic CRC patients.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning models have demonstrated the remarkable ability to infer cancer patient prognosis from molecular and anatomic pathology information. Studies in recent years have demonstrated that leveraging information from complementary multimodal data can improve prognostication, further illustrating the potential utility of such methods. Model interpretation is crucial for facilitating the clinical adoption of deep learning methods by fostering practitioner understanding and trust in the technology. However, while prior works have presented novel multimodal neural network architectures as means to improve prognostication performance, these approaches: 1) do not comprehensively leverage biological and histomorphological relationships and 2) make use of emerging strategies to “pretrain” models (i.e., train models on a slightly orthogonal dataset/modeling objective) which may aid prognostication by reducing the amount of information required for achieving optimal performance. Here, we develop an interpretable multimodal modeling framework that combines DNA methylation, gene expression, and histopathology (i.e., tissue slides) data, and we compare the performances of crossmodal pretraining, contrastive learning, and transfer learning versus the standard procedure in this context. Our models outperform the existing state-of-the-art method (average 11.54% C-index increase), and baseline clinically driven models. Our results demonstrate that the selection of pretraining strategies is crucial for obtaining highly accurate prognostication models, even more so than devising an innovative model architecture, and further emphasize the all-important role of the tumor microenvironment on disease progression.",

      "abstract": "The growing demand for biological products drives many efforts to maximize expression of heterologous proteins. Advances in high-throughput sequencing can produce data suitable for building sequence-to-expression models with machine learning. The most accurate models have been trained on one-hot encodings, a mechanism-agnostic representation of nucleotide sequences. Moreover, studies have consistently shown that training on mechanistic sequence features leads to much poorer predictions, even with features that are known to correlate with expression, such as DNA sequence motifs, codon usage or mRNA secondary structures. However, despite their excellent local accuracy, current sequence-to-expression models can fail to generalize predictions far away from the training data. Through a comparative study across datasets in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , here we show that mechanistic sequence features can provide gains on model generalization, and thus improving their utility for predictive sequence design. We explore several strategies to integrate one-hot encodings and mechanistic features into a single predictive model, including feature stacking, ensemble model stacking, and geometric stacking, a novel architecture based on graph convolutional neural networks. Our work casts new light on mechanistic sequence features, underscoring the importance of domain-knowledge and feature engineering for accurate prediction of protein expression levels.",

      "abstract": "CRISPR-based lineage tracing offers a promising avenue to decipher single cell lineage trees, especially in organisms that are challenging for microscopy. A recent advancement in this domain is lineage tracing based on sequential genome editing, which not only records genetic edits but also the order in which they occur. To capitalize on this enriched data, we introduce SciPhy, a simulation and inference tool integrated within the BEAST 2 framework. SciPhy utilizes a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to estimate time-scaled phylogenies and cell population parameters. After validating SciPhy using simulations, we apply it to lineage tracing data obtained from a monoclonal culture of HEK293T cells for which we estimate time-scaled trees together with cell proliferation rates. We compare SciPhy to the lineage reconstruction based on a widely used clustering method, UPGMA, and find that the UPGMA-reconstructed lineage trees differ from SciPhy trees in some key aspects of tree structure; in particular, SciPhy trees stand out for their later estimated cell division times. In addition, SciPhy reports uncertainty as well as proliferation rates, neither of which are available within a UPGMA analysis. This study showcases the application of advanced phylogenetic and phylodynamic tools to explore and quantify cell lineage trees, laying the groundwork for enhanced and confident analyses to decode the complexities of biological development in multicellular organisms.

      "title": "Multimodal Pre-Training Model for Sequence-based Prediction of Protein-Protein Interaction",
      "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essentials for many biological processes where two or more proteins physically bind together to achieve their functions. Modeling PPIs is useful for many biomedical applications, such as vaccine design, antibody therapeutics, and peptide drug discovery. Pre-training a protein model to learn effective representation is critical for PPIs. Most pre-training models for PPIs are sequence-based, which naively adopt the language models used in natural language processing to amino acid sequences. More advanced works utilize the structure-aware pre-training technique, taking advantage of the contact maps of known protein structures. However, neither sequences nor contact maps can fully characterize structures and functions of the proteins, which are closely related to the PPI problem. Inspired by this insight, we propose a multimodal protein pre-training model with three modalities: sequence, structure, and function (S2F). Notably, instead of using contact maps to learn the amino acid-level rigid structures, we encode the structure feature with the topology complex of point clouds of heavy atoms. It allows our model to learn structural information about not only the backbones but also the side chains. Moreover, our model incorporates the knowledge from the functional description of proteins extracted from literature or manual annotations. Our experiments show that the S2F learns protein embeddings that achieve good performances on a variety of PPIs tasks, including cross-species PPI, antibody-antigen affinity prediction, antibody neutralization prediction for SARS-CoV-2, and mutation-driven binding affinity change prediction.",

      "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics allows to study all proteins of a sample on a molecular level. However, mass spectra are noisy and contain complex patterns, making them inherently challenging to analyze with purely algorithmic approaches. In terms of the protein sequence landscape, most recent bottom-up MS-based proteomics studies consider either a diverse pool of post-translational modifications, employ large databases – as in metaproteomics or proteogenomics, study multiple isoforms of proteins, include unspecific cleavage sites or even combinations thereof. All this makes peptide and protein identifications challenging due to sheer size of the search space. To cope with this two-sided challenge, i.e. the complexity of real spectra and the search space size, we present a foundation model, called yHydra, that jointly embeds spectra and peptides. This allows us to implement various downstream tasks and search modes in Euclidean space. In particular, we implement an open search which allows to query multiple ten-thousands of spectra against millions of peptides. Furthermore, we implement an error-tolerant search for identifying additional proteoforms that are not included in off-the-shelf reference proteomes. Our foundation model provides meaningful embeddings, as we interpret learned peptide embeddings in comparison to the peptide’s physico-chemical properties. yHydra’s open search, assigns delta masses to each identification which allows to unrestrictedly characterize post-translational modifications. The error-tolerant mode of yHydra can be used as post-processing to existing search engines or as a standalone. yHydra is evaluated on several real life data sets for the identification of modified protein sequences and shows up to 25% increase in protein identification at constant false discovery rate compared to the current state-of-the-art. <h4>Availability</h4> (under MIT license) https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/yHydra <h4>Contact</h4> bernhard.renard@hpi.de",

      "abstract": "Human genome sequencing studies have identified numerous loci associated with complex diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Translating human genetic findings (i.e., genome-wide association studies [GWAS]) to pathobiology and therapeutic discovery, however, remains a major challenge. To address this critical problem, we present a net work t opology-based deep learning framework to identify disease- a ssociated g enes (NETTAG). NETTAG is capable of integrating multigenomics data along with the protein-protein interactome to infer putative risk genes and drug targets impacted by GWAS loci. Specifically, we leverage non-coding GWAS loci effects on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), histone-QTLs, and transcription factor binding-QTLs, enhancers and CpG islands, promoter regions, open chromatin, and promoter flanking regions. The key premises of NETTAG are that the disease risk genes exhibit distinct functional characteristics compared to non-risk genes and therefore can be distinguished by their aggregated genomic features under the human protein interactome. Applying NETTAG to the latest AD GWAS data, we identified 156 putative AD-risk genes (i.e., APOE , BIN1 , GSK3B , MARK4 , and PICALM ). We showed that predicted risk genes are: 1) significantly enriched in AD-related pathobiological pathways, 2) more likely to be differentially expressed regarding transcriptome and proteome of AD brains, and 3) enriched in druggable targets with approved medicines (i.e., choline and ibudilast). In summary, our findings suggest that understanding of human pathobiology and therapeutic development could benefit from a network-based deep learning methodology that utilizes GWAS findings under the multimodal genomic analyses.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent and devastating form of oncogene amplification in cancer 1,2 . Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres and segregate stochastically during cell division 3–6 yet persist over many generations. EcDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei over 40 years ago with unknown mechanism 3,7 . Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. We develop Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that reveals thousands of human retention elements conferring generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromatin conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions which are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins, intermolecularly recapitulating promoter-enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated; targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, suggesting that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, revealing the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.",

      "abstract": "Computational variant effect predictors (VEPs) and multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs) are two key tools for assessing the functional consequences of genetic variants. While their outputs are often concordant, there are also many differences. Here, we analyse missense MAVE data from 37 different human proteins, comparing them to five state-of-the-art VEPs in order to quantify and explain their points of agreement and disagreement. We find that discordance is not random but reflects fundamental differences in how each method infers functional impact. VEPs, which rely heavily on sequence conservation and basic structural features, tend to overcall pathogenicity at buried and hydrophobic residues, while underestimating impact in disordered regions and on charged surface residues. MAVEs, by contrast, capture context-specific mechanisms more accurately, but can miss pathogenic variants when the assay fails to reflect disease biology, or be subject to high levels of experimental noise. By comparing both global patterns and specific clinically relevant variants, we show how protein features, assay design, and variant type shape predictive discordance. Our findings provide a framework for interpreting when and why VEPs and MAVEs diverge and point toward strategies for improving variant interpretation through integrated, mechanism-aware approaches.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Motivation</h4> Knowing the relation between cell types is crucial for translating experimental results from mice to humans. Establishing cell type matches, however, is hindered by the biological differences between the species. A substantial amount of evolutionary information between genes that could be used to align the species is discarded by most of the current methods since they only use one-to-one orthologous genes. Some methods try to retain the information by explicitly including the relation between genes, however, not without caveats. <h4>Results</h4> In this work, we present a model to Transfer and Align Cell Types in Cross-Species analysis (TACTiCS). First, TACTiCS uses a natural language processing model to match genes using their protein sequences. Next, TACTiCS employs a neural network to classify cell types within a species. Afterwards, TACTiCS uses transfer learning to propagate cell type labels between species. We applied TACTiCS on scRNA-seq data of the primary motor cortex of human, mouse and marmoset. Our model can accurately match and align cell types on these datasets. Moreover, at a high resolution, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method SAMap. Finally, we show that our gene matching method results in better matches than BLAST, both in our model and SAMap. <h4>Availability</h4> https://github.com/kbiharie/TACTiCS <h4>Contact</h4> a.mahfouz@lumc.nl",

Proteome-wide discovery efforts predict thousands of novel RBPs, many of which lack canonical RNA-binding domains. Here, we present a hybrid ensemble RBP classifier (HydRA) that leverages information from both intermolecular protein interactions and internal protein sequence patterns to predict RNA-binding capacity with unparalleled specificity and sensitivity using support vector machine, convolutional neural networks and transformer-based protein language models. HydRA enables Occlusion Mapping to robustly detect known RNA-binding domains and to predict hundreds of uncharacterized RNA-binding domains. Enhanced CLIP validation for a diverse collection of RBP candidates reveals genome-wide targets and confirms RNA-binding activity for HydRA-predicted domains. The HydRA computational framework accelerates construction of a comprehensive RBP catalogue and expands the set of known RNA-binding protein domains. <h4>Highlights</h4> HydRA combines protein-protein interaction and amino acid sequence information to predict RNA binding activity for 1,487 candidate genes. HydRA predicts RNA binding with higher specificity and sensitivity than current approaches, notably for RBPs without well-defined RNA-binding domains. Occlusion Mapping with HydRA enables RNA-binding domain discovery. Enhanced CLIP confirms HydRA RBP predictions with RNA-binding domain resolution.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background/Objectives</h4> Polygenic scores (PGS), which estimate an individual’s genetic propensity for a disease or trait, have the potential to become part of genomic healthcare. In maximising the predictive performance of PGS, neural-network (NN) based deep learning has emerged as a method of intense interest to model complex, nonlinear phenomena, which may be adapted to exploit gene-gene (G x G) and gene-environment (G x E) interactions. <h4>Methods</h4> To infer the amount of nonlinearity present in a phenotype, we present a framework for using NNs, which controls for the potential confounding effect of correlation between genetic variants, i.e. linkage disequilibrium (LD). We fit NN models to both simulated traits and 28 real disease and anthropometric traits in the UK Biobank. <h4>Results</h4> Simulations confirmed that our framework adequately controls LD and can infer nonlinear effects, when such effects genuinely exist. Using this approach on real data, we found evidence for small amounts of nonlinearity due to G x G and G x E which mildly improved prediction performance (r 2 ) by ∼7% and ∼4%, respectively. Despite evidence for nonlinear effects, NN models were outperformed by linear regression models for both genetic-only and genetic+environmental input scenarios with ∼7% and ∼5% differences in r 2 , respectively. Importantly, we found substantial evidence for confounding by joint tagging effects, whereby inferred G x G was actually LD with due to unaccounted for additive genetic variants. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Our results indicate that the usefulness of NNs for generating polygenic scores for common traits and diseases may currently be limited and may be confounded by joint tagging effects due to LD.",

      "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing techniques and sequence analysis have enabled the taxonomic classification of pathogens present in clinical samples. Sequencing provides an unbiased identification and systematic classification of pathogens and this is generally achieved by comparing novel sequences to pre-existing annotated reference databases. However, this approach is limited by large-scale reference databases which require considerable computational resources and skills to compare against. Alternative robust methods such as machine learning are currently employed in genome sequence analysis and classification, and it can be applied in classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants, whose continued evolution has resulted in the emergence of multiple variants. We developed a deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model to classify dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants (omicron, delta, beta, gamma and alpha) based on gene sequences from the surface glycoprotein (spike gene). We trained and validated the model using > 26,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the GISAID database. The model was evaluated using unseen 3,057 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The model was compared to existing molecular epidemiology tool, nextclade. Our model achieved an accuracy of 98.55% on training, 99.19% on the validation and 98.41% on the test dataset. Comparing the proposed model to nextclade, the model achieved significant accuracy in classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants from unseen data. Nextclade identified the presence of recombinant strains in the evaluation data, a mechanism that the proposed model did not detect. This study provides an alternative approach to pre-existing methods employed in the classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Timely classification will enable effective monitoring and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants and inform public health policies in the control and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Here, we investigated sex differences in retinal vascular phenotypes, which are emerging as non-invasive biomarkers for ocular, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. We used both interaction and sex-stratified analyses in disease association and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including the X chromosome. Our analyses revealed sex-specific differences in associations between retinal traits, cardiometabolic risk factors, and disease outcomes. Several phenotypes showed prognostic value for mortality and cardiovascular endpoints, predominantly in one sex, illustrating the limitations of sex-agnostic analyses. Genetic analyses revealed differences in genetic architectures, with females exhibiting higher heritability and a greater number of associated loci, as well as sex-specific trait-gene associations. Notably, we report the first genetic association on the X chromosome for retinal vascular phenotypes. These findings suggest sex-differential genetic and environmental contributions to microvascular morphology, possibly reflecting divergent biological pathways and risk profiles. Our study underscores the necessity of integrating SABV and sex-aware approaches in genetic and prognostic research to advance precision medicine and improve tailored risk stratification.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a global health challenge that affects millions of women worldwide and leads to significant mortality. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled comprehensive diagnosis and prognosis determination using multiple data modalities. Deep learning methods have shown promise in utilizing these multimodal data sources, outperforming single-modal models. However, integrating these heterogeneous data sources poses significant challenges in clinical decision-making. This study proposes an optimized multimodal CNN for a stacked ensemble model (OMCNNSE) for breast cancer prognosis. Our novel method involves the integration of the Tug of War (TWO) algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network (CNN), enhancing feature extraction from three distinct multimodal datasets: clinical profile data, copy number alteration (CNA), and gene expression data. Specifically, we employ the TWO algorithm to optimize separate CNN models for each dataset, identifying optimal values for the hyperparameters. We then trained the three baseline CNN models using the optimized values through 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, we utilize an ensemble learning approach to integrate the models' predictions and apply an SVM classifier for the final prediction. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the METABRIC breast cancer dataset comprising diverse patient profiles. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of the OMCNNSE approach for predicting breast cancer prognosis. The model achieved high AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and MCC, outperforming traditional single-modal models and other state-of-the-art methods.",

Integration of features across spatial neighbours can retrieve tissues and organs, revealing, for example, a detailed organization of the animal foregut.

      "abstract": "<h4>Motivation</h4> Understanding the functional consequence of genetic variants, especially the noncoding ones, is important but particularly challenging. Genome-wide association studies or quantitative trait locus analyses may be subject to limited statistical power and linkage disequilibrium, and thus are less optimal to pinpoint the causal variants. Moreover, most existing machine learning approaches, which exploit the functional annotations to interpret and prioritize putative causal variants, cannot accommodate the heterogeneity of personal genetic variations and traits in a population study, targeting a specific disease. <h4>Results</h4> By leveraging paired whole genome sequencing data and epigenetic functional assays in a population study, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict genome-wide quantitative epigenetic signals by considering both personal genetic variations and traits. The proposed approach can further evaluate the functional consequence of noncoding variants on an individual level by quantifying the allelic difference of predicted epigenetic signals. By applying the approach to the ROSMAP cohort studying Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict quantitative genome-wide epigenetic signals and in key genomic regions of AD causal genes, learn canonical motifs reported to regulate gene expression of AD causal genes, improve the partitioning heritability analysis, and prioritize putative causal variants in a GWAS risk locus.

      "abstract": "In biology, messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a crucial role in gene expression and protein synthesis. Accurate predictive modeling of mRNA properties can greatly enhance our understanding and manipulation of biological processes, leading to advancements in medical and biotechnological applications. Utilizing bio-language foundation models allows for leveraging large-scale pretrained knowledge, which can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of these predictions. However, mRNA specific foundation models are notably limited posing challenges for efficient predictive modeling in mRNA-focused tasks. In contrast, DNA and protein modalities have numerous general-purpose foundation models trained on billions of sequences. This paper explores the potential for adaptation of existing DNA and protein bio-language models for mRNA-focused tasks. Through experiments using various mRNA datasets curated from both public domain and internal proprietary database, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNA and protein models can be effectively transferred for mRNA-focused tasks using various adaptation techniques such as probing, full-rank, and low-rank finetuning. In addition, we identify key factors that influence successful adaptation, offering guidelines on when general-purpose DNA and protein models are likely to perform well for mRNA-focused tasks. We further assess the impact of model size on adaptation efficacy, finding that medium-scale models often outperform larger ones for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We conclude that by leveraging the interconnectedness of DNA, mRNA, and proteins, as outlined by the central dogma of molecular biology, the knowledge in foundation models can be effectively transferred across modalities, significantly enhancing the repertoire of computational tools available for mRNA analysis.",

Computational protein design cannot yet fully mimic nature’s ability to engineer new proteins from existing templates. Protein language models generate informative per-residue representations, but leveraging them to execute large-scale, function-preserving mutations and indels has remained beyond reach. We introduce Raygun, a generative AI framework that unlocks efficient miniaturization, modification, and augmentation of proteins, using a novel probabilistic encoding of protein sequences constructed from language model embeddings. Emulating evolution, Raygun shrinks proteins by 10-25% (sometimes over 50%) while preserving predicted structural integrity and fidelity, introduces extensive sequence diversity while preserving functional sites, and can expand proteins beyond their natural size. These capabilities unlock new opportunities in gene therapy and biotechnology. In cell-based validation, Raygun successfully miniaturized fluorescent proteins, two of which are smaller than 96% of fluorescent proteins reported in FPbase, as well as TurboID, a synthetic biotin ligase widely adopted for proteomics. It also successfully expanded Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), a natural binding partner to the EGFR protein, generating EGF variants with higher binding affinity than the wildtype. Raygun’s conceptual innovations in template-based protein design reveal that protein function can be encoded in a length-independent space.

      "abstract": "The acquisition of multi-modal biological data for the same sample, such as RNA sequencing and whole slide imaging (WSI), has increased in recent years, enabling studying human biology from multiple angles. However, despite these emerging multi-modal efforts, for the majority of studies only one modality is typically available, mostly due to financial or logistical constraints. Given these difficulties, multi-modal data imputation and multi-modal synthetic data generation are appealing as a solution for the multi-modal data scarcity problem. Currently, most studies focus on generating a single modality (e.g. WSI), without leveraging the information provided by additional data modalities (e.g. gene expression profiles). In this work, we propose an approach to generate WSI tiles by using deep generative models infused with matched gene expression profiles. First, we train a variational autoencoder (VAE) that learns a latent, lower dimensional representation of multi-tissue gene expression profiles. Then, we use this representation to infuse generative adversarial networks (GAN) that generate lung and brain cortex tissue tiles, resulting in a new model that we call RNA-GAN. Tiles generated by RNA-GAN were preferred by expert pathologists in comparison to tiles generated using traditional GANs and in addition, RNA-GAN needs fewer training epochs to generate high-quality tiles. Finally, RNA-GAN was able to generalize to gene expression profiles outside of the training set, showing imputation capabilities. A web-based quiz is available for users to play a game distinguishing real and synthetic tiles: https://rna-gan.stanford.edu/ and the code for RNA-GAN is available here: https://github.com/gevaertlab/RNA-GAN .",

      "abstract": "Genotype-phenotype association is found in many biological systems, such as brain-related diseases and behavioral traits. Despite the recent improvement in the prediction of phenotypes from genotypes, they can be further improved and explainability of these predictions remains challenging, primarily due to complex underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Emerging multimodal data enables studying such mechanisms at different scales from genotype to phenotypes involving intermediate phenotypes like gene expression. However, due to the black-box nature of many machine learning techniques, it is challenging to integrate these multi-modalities and interpret the biological insights in prediction, especially when some modality is missing. Biological knowledge has recently been incorporated into machine learning modeling to help understand the reasoning behind the choices made by these models. To this end, we developed DeepGAMI, an interpretable deep learning model to improve genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI uses prior biological knowledge to define the neural network architecture. Notably, it embeds an auxiliary-learning layer for cross-modal imputation while training the model from multimodal data. Using this pre-trained layer, we can impute latent features of additional modalities and thus enable predicting phenotypes from a single modality only. Finally, the model uses integrated gradient to prioritize multimodal features and links for phenotypes. We applied DeepGAMI to multiple emerging multimodal datasets: (1) population-level genotype and bulk-tissue gene expression data for predicting schizophrenia, (2) population-level genotype and gene expression data for predicting clinical phenotypes in Alzheimer’s Disease, (3) gene expression and electrophysiological data of single neuronal cells in the mouse visual cortex, and (4) cell-type gene expression and genotype data for predicting schizophrenia. We found that DeepGAMI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and provides a profound understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms from genotype to phenotype, especially at cellular resolution. DeepGAMI is an open-source tool and is available at https://github.com/daifengwanglab/DeepGAMI .",

      "abstract": "Access to large, annotated samples represents a considerable challenge for training accurate deep-learning models in medical imaging. While current leading-edge transfer learning from pre-trained models can help with cases lacking data, it limits design choices, and generally results in the use of unnecessarily large models. We propose a novel, self-supervised training scheme for obtaining high-quality, pre-trained networks from unlabeled, cross-modal medical imaging data, which will allow for creating accurate and efficient models. We demonstrate this by accurately predicting optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based retinal thickness measurements from simple infrared (IR) fundus images. Subsequently, learned representations outperformed advanced classifiers on a separate diabetic retinopathy classification task in a scenario of scarce training data. Our cross-modal, three-staged scheme effectively replaced 26,343 diabetic retinopathy annotations with 1,009 semantic segmentations on OCT and reached the same classification accuracy using only 25% of fundus images, without any drawbacks, since OCT is not required for predictions. We expect this concept will also apply to other multimodal clinical data-imaging, health records, and genomics data, and be applicable to corresponding sample-starved learning problems.",

We demonstrate complementary brain-wide and single-cell biochemical mapping via MEISTER, an integrative experimental and computational mass spectrometry framework.

We imaged detailed lipid profiles in tissues with data sets containing millions of pixels, and in large single-cell populations acquired from the rat brain. We identified region-specific lipid contents, and cell-specific localizations of lipids depending on both cell subpopulations and anatomical origins of the cells.

      "title": "A Graph Neural Network Approach for Hierarchical Mapping of Breast Cancer Protein Communities",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Background  Comprehensively mapping the hierarchical structure of breast cancer protein communities and identifying potential biomarkers from them is a promising way for breast cancer research. Existing approaches are subjective and fail to take information from protein sequences into consideration. Deep learning can automatically learn features from protein sequences and protein-protein interactions for hierarchical clustering. Results  Using a large amount of publicly available proteomics data, we created a hierarchical tree for breast cancer protein communities using a novel hierarchical graph neural network, with the supervision of gene ontology terms and assistance of a pre-trained deep contextual language model. Then, a group-lasso algorithm was applied to identify protein communities that are under both mutation burden and survival burden, undergo significant alterations when targeted by specific drug molecules, and show cancer-dependent perturbations. The resulting hierarchical map of protein communities shows how gene-level mutations and survival information converge on protein communities at different scales. Internal validity of the model was established through the convergence on BRCA2 as a breast cancer hotspot. Further overlaps with breast cancer cell dependencies revealed SUPT6H and RAD21, along with their respective protein systems, HOST:37 and HOST:861, as potential biomarkers. Using gene-level perturbation data of the HOST:37 and HOST:861 gene sets, three FDA-approved drugs with high therapeutic value were selected as potential treatments to be further evaluated. These drugs include mercaptopurine, pioglitazone, and colchicine. Conclusion  The proposed graph neural network approach to analyzing breast cancer protein communities in a hierarchical structure provides a novel perspective on breast cancer prognosis and treatment. By targeting entire gene sets, we were able to evaluate the prognostic and therapeutic value of genes (or gene sets) at different levels, from gene-level to system-level biology. Cancer-specific gene dependencies provide additional context for pinpointing cancer-related systems and drug-induced alterations can highlight potential therapeutic targets. These identified protein communities, in conjunction with other protein communities under strong mutation and survival burdens, can potentially be used as clinical biomarkers for breast cancer.</p>",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Diagnosis at late stages is common due to the largely non-specific nature of presenting symptoms contributing to high mortality. There is a lack of specific, minimally invasive low-cost tests to screen patients ahead of the diagnostic biopsy. <h4>Patients and Methods</h4> 344 symptomatic patients from the lung clinic of Lister hospital suspected of lung cancer were recruited. Predictive covariates were successfully generated on 170 patients from Computed Tomography (CT) scans using CT Texture Analysis (CTTA) and Deep Learning Autoencoders (DLA) as well as from peripheral blood data for immunity using high depth flow-cytometry and for exosome protein components. Predictive signatures were formed by combining covariates using Bayesian regression on a randomly chosen 128-patient training set and validated on a 42-patient held-out set. Final signatures were generated by fusing the data sources at different levels. <h4>Results</h4> Immune and DLA were the best single modality signatures with test set AUCs of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.61 – 0.91) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60 - 0.90) respectively. The final combined signature had a ROC AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.73 - 0.99) on the withheld test set. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.722 and 0.901 respectively. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Combining immune monitoring with CT scan data is an effective approach to improving sensitivity and specificity of Lung cancer screening even in symptomatic patients. <h4>Highlights</h4> Combining immune monitoring in peripheral blood with CT scan data improves lung cancer screening sensitivity and specificity. Elevated levels of KIR3DL1+ CD8 T cells may be indicative of cancer. A cancer biomarker that combines a deep learning autoencoder with peripheral immune profiling achieved a 0.86 ORC AUC.",

Here, we present MOSAIC, a reconfigurable microscope that integrates multiple advanced imaging techniques including light-sheet, label-free, super-resolution, and multi-photon, all equipped with adaptive optics. MOSAIC enables non-invasive imaging of subcellular dynamics in both cultured cells and live multicellular organisms, nanoscale mapping of molecular architectures across millimeter-scale expanded tissues, and structural/functional neural imaging within live mice.

      "abstract": "Cortical folding of brain is widely regarded as an interplay between genetic programming and biomechanical forces, closely linked to cytoarchitectonic regionalisation. Abnormal folding patterns are frequently observed in neurodevelopmental conditions and psychiatric disorders. However, significant inter-individual variability of secondary and tertiary folds obscures detection of shape biomarkers and confounds investigation of folding-functional relationships. Here we investigate cortical folding heterogeneity at fine scale, using novel hierarchical surface registration (MSM-HT) to parse cortical folding patterns into a representative family of distinct anatomical templates. By applying this technique both to young adults from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and neonates in the Developing HCP and Brain Imaging in Babies (BIBS) cohorts, we identify and characterize common lobe-wise folding patterns: observing consistency across both age groups, with neonatal samples showing less variation. Crucially, we highlight significant hemispheric asymmetry within the temporal lobe for both adults and neonates, and show that improved correspondence of shape does not translate to improved areal correspondence, affirming previous studies that have pointed to dissociation of folding and functional organisation. This study provides a critical step towards understanding brain asymmetry and complex relationships between folding and function, offering a robust framework to generalise the uncovered cortical folding motifs across datasets and developmental stages.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized image analysis and natural language processing with remarkable accuracies in prediction tasks, such as image labeling and semantic segmentation or named-entity recognition and semantic role labeling. Specifically, the combination of algorithmic and hardware advances with the appearance of large and well-labeled datasets has led up to seminal contributions in these fields. The emergence of large amounts of data from single-cell RNA-seq and the recent global effort to chart all cell types in the Human Cell Atlas has attracted an interest in deep-learning applications. However, all current approaches are unsupervised, i.e. , learning of latent spaces without using any cell labels, even though supervised learning approaches are often more powerful in feature learning and the most popular approach in the current AI revolution by far. Here, we ask why this is the case. In particular we ask whether supervised deep learning can be used for cell annotation, i.e. to predict cell-type labels from single-cell gene expression profiles. After evaluating 10 classification methods across 14 datasets, we notably find that deep learning does not outperform classical machine-learning methods in the task. Thus, cell-type prediction based on gene-signature derived cell-type labels is potentially too simplistic a task for complex non-linear methods, which demands better labels of functional single-cell readouts.",

      "abstract": "Language models are thriving, powering conversational agents that assist and empower humans to solve a number of tasks. Recently, these models were extended to support additional modalities including vision, audio and video, demonstrating impressive capabilities across multiple domains including healthcare. Still, conversational agents remain limited in biology as they cannot yet fully comprehend biological sequences. On the other hand, high-performance foundation models for biological sequences have been built through self-supervision over sequencing data, but these need to be fine-tuned for each specific application, preventing transfer and generalization between tasks. In addition, these models are not conversational which limits their utility to users with coding capabilities. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between biology foundation models and conversational agents by introducing ChatNT, the first multimodal conversational agent with an advanced understanding of biological sequences. ChatNT achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Nucleotide Transformer benchmark while being able to solve all tasks at once, in English, and to generalize to unseen questions. In addition, we have curated a new set of more biologically relevant instructions tasks from DNA, RNA and proteins, spanning multiple species, tissues and biological processes. ChatNT reaches performance on par with state-of-the-art specialized methods on those tasks. We also present a novel perplexity-based technique to help calibrate the confidence of our model predictions. Our framework for genomics instruction-tuning can be easily extended to more tasks and biological data modalities (e.g. structure, imaging), making it a widely applicable tool for biology. ChatNT is the first model of its kind and constitutes an initial step towards building generally capable agents that understand biology from first principles while being accessible to users with no coding background.",

Recent advances in deep representation learning have demonstrated promise in overcoming similar challenges in related fields, particularly in the context of single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data analysis. Here, we propose flowVI , a multimodal deep generative model, tailored for integrative analysis of multiple massively parallel cytometry datasets from diverse sources. By effectively modeling noise variances, technical biases, and batch-specific heterogeneity using probabilistic data representation, we demonstrate that flowVI not only excels in the imputation of missing protein markers but also seamlessly integrates data from distinct cytometry panels. FlowVI thus emerges as a potent tool for constructing comprehensive flow cytometry atlases and enhancing the precision of flow cytometry data analyses.

Here, we develop a hybrid modeling approach to bridge this gap. Our approach combines statistical and mechanistic models to predict cells’ electrophysiological activity from their gene expression pattern. To this end, we fit biophysical Hodgkin-Huxley-based models for a wide variety of cortical cell types using simulation-based inference, while overcoming the challenge posed by the mismatch between the mathematical model and the data. Using multimodal Patch-seq data, we link the estimated model parameters to gene expression using an interpretable sparse linear regression model.

The neurodevelopmental disorder Pilarowski-Bjornsson syndrome (PILBOS) was initially described in females. Here, we describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of the largest PILBOS cohort to date, showing that both sexes can exhibit PILBOS features, although males are overrepresented. A mouse model carrying a human-derived Chd1 missense variant ( Chd1 R 616 Q /+ ) displays female-restricted phenotypes, including growth deficiency, anxiety and hypotonia. Orchiectomy unmasks a growth deficiency phenotype in male Chd1 R 616 Q /+ mice, while testosterone rescues the phenotype in females, implicating androgens in phenotype modulation. In the gnomAD and UK Biobank databases, rare missense variants in CHD1 are overrepresented in males, supporting a male protective effect.

      "abstract": "Thalamic brain areas play an important role in adaptive behaviors. Nevertheless, the population dynamics of thalamic relays during learning across sensory modalities remain mostly unknown. Using a cross-modal sensory reversal learning paradigm combined with deep brain two-photon calcium imaging of large populations of auditory thalamus (MGB) neurons, we identified that MGB neurons are biased towards reward predictors independent of modality. Additionally, functional classes of MGB neurons aligned with distinct task periods and behavioral outcomes, both dependent and independent of sensory modality. During non-sensory delay periods, MGB ensembles developed coherent neuronal representation as well as distinct co-activity network states reflecting predicted task outcome. These results demonstrate flexible cross-modal ensemble coding in auditory thalamus during adaptive learning and highlight its importance in brain-wide cross-modal computations during complex behavior. <h4>Summary</h4> Deep brain imaging reveals flexible network states of sensory thalamus predicting task outcome in mice.",

This paper describes novel experimental data and a novel prediction model for challenging CCS prediction tasks including longer peptides that tend to have higher charge states. The proposed model is based on a pretrained deep protein language model. While the conventional prediction model requires training from scratch, the proposed model enables training with less amount of time owing to the use of the pretrained model as a feature extractor. Results of experiments with the novel experimental data show that the proposed model succeeds in drastically reducing the training time while maintaining the same or even better prediction performance compared with the conventional method.

      "abstract": "Machine learning-guided protein engineering continues to rapidly progress, however, collecting large, well-labeled data sets remains time and resource intensive. Directed evolution and protein engineering studies often require extensive experimental processes to eliminate noise and fully label high-throughput protein sequence-function data. Meta learning methods established in other fields (e.g. computer vision and natural language processing) have proven effective in learning from noisy data, given the availability of a small data set with trusted labels and thus could be applied for protein engineering. Here, we generate yeast display antibody mutagenesis libraries and screen them for target antigen binding followed by deep sequencing. Meta learning approaches are able to learn under high synthetic and experimental noise as well as in under labeled data settings, typically outperforming baselines significantly and often requiring a fraction of the training data. Thus, we demonstrate meta learning may expedite and improve machine learning-guided protein engineering. <h4>Availability and implementation</h4> The code used in this study is publicly available at https://github.com/LSSI-ETH/meta-learning-for-protein-engineering . <h4>Graphical Abstract</h4>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Antagonistic interactions with viruses are an important driver of the ecology and evolution of bacteria, and associating genetic signatures to these interactions is of fundamental importance to predict viral infection success. Recent studies have highlighted that bacteria possess a large, rapidly changing arsenal of defense genes and that viruses can neutralize at least some of these genes with matching anti-defenses. However, a broadly applicable approach for discovering the genetic underpinnings of such interactions is missing since typically used methods such as comparative genomics are limited by the rampant horizontal gene transfer and poor annotation of viral and bacterial genes. Here we show that genes that allow the viruses to overcome bacterial defenses can be systematically identified using an interpretable machine-learning approach even when using diverse bacteria-virus infection data. To verify the predictions, we experimentally characterized eight previously unknown anti-defense proteins in viruses specific for Vibrio bacteria and showed that they counteract a wide range of bacterial immune systems, including AbiH, AbiU, Septu, DRT, CBASS, and Retron. The power of our computational approach is highlighted by the identification of anti-defense proteins that inhibit non-homologous defense systems, which we verify for Retron and AbiH. We suggest that the computational prediction based on experimental interactions offers a promising avenue to unravel the genetic mechanisms of co-evolution between bacteria and their viruses.</p>",

Computational tools, based on classic machine learning, have been successful at predicting PPIs in silico , but the lack of consistent and reliable frameworks for this task has led to network models that are difficult to compare and discrepancies between algorithms that remain unexplained. To better understand the underlying inference mechanisms that underpin these models, we designed an open-source framework for benchmarking that accounts for a range of biological and statistical pitfalls while facilitating reproducibility. We use it to shed light on the impact of network topology and how different algorithms deal with highly connected proteins. By studying functional genomics-based and sequence-based models on human PPIs, we show their complementarity as the former performs best on lone proteins while the latter specialises in interactions involving hubs. We also show that algorithm design has little impact on performance with functional genomic data. We replicate our results between both human and S. cerevisiae data and demonstrate that models using functional genomics are better suited to PPI prediction across species. With rapidly increasing amounts of sequence and functional genomics data, our study provides a principled foundation for future construction, comparison and application of PPI networks.",

      "abstract": "During discourse comprehension, every new word adds to an evolving representation of meaning that accumulates over consecutive sentences and constrains the next words. To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word ‘she’, to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells’ preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network which is recruited during language comprehension. This study uniquely demonstrates, at the single-cell level, how memory and language are linked.",

      "abstract": "Our perception of the world depends on the brain’s ability to integrate information from multiple senses, with temporal disparities providing a critical cue for binding or segregating cross-modal signals 1,2 . The superior colliculus (SC) is a key site for integrating sensory modalities, but how cellular and network mechanisms in distinct anatomical regions within the SC contribute to multisensory integration remains poorly understood. Here, we recorded responses from over 5,000 neurons across the SC’s anatomical axes of awake mice during presentations of spatially coincident audiovisual stimuli with varying temporal asynchronies. Our findings revealed that multisensory neurons reliably encoded audiovisual delays and exhibited nonlinear summation of auditory and visual inputs, with nonlinearities being more pronounced when visual stimuli preceded auditory stimuli, consistent with the natural statistics of light and sound propagation. Nonlinear summation was crucial for population-level decoding accuracy and precision of AV delay representation. Moreover, enhanced population decoding of audiovisual delays in the posterior-medial SC, facilitated temporal discriminability in the peripheral visual field. Cross-correlation analysis indicated higher connectivity in the medial SC and functional specific recurrent connectivity, with visual, auditory, and multisensory neurons preferentially connecting to other neurons of the same functional subclass, and multisensory neurons receiving approximately 50 percent of the total local input from other multisensory neurons. Our results highlight the interplay between single-neuron computations, network connectivity, and population coding in the SC, where nonlinear integration, distributed representations and regional functional specialisations enables robust sensory binding and supports the accurate encoding of temporal multisensory information. Our study provides new insights into how the brain leverages both single-neuron and network-level mechanisms to represent sensory features by adapting to the statistics of the natural world.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with extensive structural brain changes. Recent work has proposed that the spatial pattern of disease pathology is shaped by both network spread and local vulnerability. However, only few studies assessed these biological frameworks in large patient samples across disease stages. Analyzing the largest imaging cohort in PD to date (N = 3,096 patients), we investigated the roles of network architecture and local brain features by relating regional abnormality maps to normative profiles of connectivity, intrinsic networks, cytoarchitectonics, neurotransmitter receptor densities, and gene expression. We found widespread cortical and subcortical atrophy in PD to be associated with advancing disease stage, longer time since diagnosis, and poorer global cognition. Structural brain connectivity best explained cortical atrophy patterns in PD and across disease stages. These patterns were robust among individual patients. The precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, and amygdala were identified as likely network-based epicentres, with high convergence across disease stages. Individual epicentres varied significantly among patients, yet they consistently localized to the default mode and limbic networks. Furthermore, we showed that regional overexpression of genes implicated in synaptic structure and signalling conferred increased susceptibility to brain atrophy in PD. In summary, this study demonstrates in a well-powered sample that structural brain abnormalities in PD across disease stages and within individual patients are influenced by both network spread and local vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "There is a rich literature describing loss of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons following peripheral axotomy, but the vulnerability of discrete subpopulations has not yet been characterised. Furthermore, the extent and even presence of neuron loss following injury has recently been challenged. In this study, we have used a range of transgenic recombinase driver mouse lines to genetically label molecularly defined subpopulations of DRG neurons and track their survival following traumatic nerve injury. We find that spared nerve injury (SNI) leads to a marked loss of cell containing DRG-volume and a concomitant loss of small diameter DRG neurons. Neuron loss occurs unequally across subpopulations and is particularly prevalent in non-peptidergic nociceptors, marked by expression of Mrgprd. We show that this subpopulation is almost entirely lost following SNI and severely depleted (by roughly 50%) following sciatic nerve crush. Finally, we used an in vitro model of DRG neuron survival to demonstrate that non-peptidergic nociceptor loss is likely dependent on the absence of neurotrophic support. Together, these results profile the extent to which DRG neuron subpopulations can survive axotomy, with implications for our understanding of nerve injury-induced plasticity and pain.",

The relative timing and evolutionary dynamics of subclones that have escaped immune control remain incompletely characterized, and how immune-mediated selection shapes the epigenome has received little attention. Here, we infer the genome- and epigenome-driven evolutionary dynamics of tumour-immune coevolution within primary colorectal cancers (CRCs). We utilise our existing CRC multi-region multi-omic dataset that we supplement with high-resolution spatially-resolved neoantigen sequencing data and highly multiplexed imaging of the tumour microenvironment (TME). Analysis of somatic chromatin accessibility alterations (SCAAs) reveals frequent somatic loss of accessibility at antigen presenting genes, and that SCAAs contribute to silencing of neoantigens. We observe that strong immune escape and exclusion occur at the outset of CRC formation, and that within tumours, including at the microscopic level of individual tumour glands, additional immune escape alterations have negligible consequences for the immunophenotype of cancer cells. Further minor immuno-editing occurs during local invasion and is associated with TME reorganisation, but that evolutionary bottleneck is relatively weak. Collectively, we show that immune evasion in CRC follows a “Big Bang” evolutionary pattern, whereby genetic, epigenetic and TME-driven immune evasion acquired by the time of transformation defines subsequent cancer-immune evolution.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Pandemic preparedness has gained high relevance throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, necessitating optimized therapeutic strategies for early phase disease management. Predicting patient-specific outcomes, particularly for novel infectious diseases with complex multimorbidity patterns, presents significant challenges due to limited availability of disease-specific patient datasets and an incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms early in the disease wave. We propose a concept for rapid predictive modeling of disease outcomes based on the hypothesis of common disease-promoting mechanisms and leveraging transfer learning across different disease types. Introducing the Medical Reference Space (MRS) as a unifying framework to integrate heterogeneous clinical data structures, allows us to monitor therapy response dynamics and predict individual outcomes across various diseases. We performed a retrospective analysis on mechanically ventilated patients from intensive care units, comprising 495 COVID and 6212 non-COVID patients. The results demonstrate that MRS-based models, trained on non-COVID patients, effectively predict individual survival in COVID-19 patients, comparable to models trained exclusively on COVID data. Moreover, the MRS approach provides insights into the impact of rapidly evolving events, such as sepsis, on the predictivity of machine learning-based prognostic systems indicating conceptual limitations for patient-specific decision support systems. Our findings highlight the potential of using retrospective patient data repositories for transfer learning as a rapid strategy for predicting disease outcomes of new evolving diseases, opening a route towards future pandemic preparedness.</p>",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform many aspects of society, and the study of evolutionary morphology is no exception. Machine learning-grade methods of AI such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis have been commonplace in evolutionary morphology for decades, but the last decade has seen increasing application of Deep Learning to ecology and evolutionary biology, opening up the potential to circumvent longstanding barriers to rapid, big data analysis of phenotype. Here we review the current state of AI methods available for the study of evolutionary morphology and discuss the prospectus for near-term advances in specific subfields of this research area, including the potential of new AI methods that have not yet been applied to the study of morphological evolution. We introduce the main available AI techniques, categorising them into three stages based on their order of appearance: (i) Machine Learning, (ii) Deep Learning with neural networks and (iii) the most recent advancements in large-scale models and multimodal learning. Next, we present existing AI approaches and case studies using AI for evolutionary morphology, including image capture and segmentation, feature recognition, morphometrics, phylogenetics, and biomechanics. Finally, we discuss areas where there is potential, but no current application of AI to key areas in evolutionary morphology. Combined, these advancements and potential developments have the capacity to transform the evolutionary analysis of organismal phenotype into evolutionary phenomics, launch it fully in the “Big Data'' sphere, and align it with genomics and other areas of bioinformatics.",

Researches on this subject have been focused on analyzing the genetic structure of the virus, developing vaccines, the course of the disease, and its source. In this study, RNA sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are transformed into gene motifs with two basic image processing algorithms and classified with the convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The CNN models achieved an average of 98% Area Under Curve(AUC) value was achieved in RNA sequences classified as Asia, Europe, America, and Oceania. The resulting artificial neural network model was used for phylogenetic analysis of the variant of the virus isolated in Turkey. The classification results reached were compared with gene alignment values in the GISAID database, where SARS-CoV-2 virus records are kept all over the world. Our experimental results have revealed that now the detection of the geographic distribution of the virus with the CNN models might serve as an efficient method.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> N6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) exerts many of its regulatory effects on eukaryotic mRNAs by recruiting cytoplasmic YT521-B homology domain family (YTHDF) proteins. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis, the interaction between m 6 A and the major YTHDF protein ECT2 also involves the mRNA-binding ALBA protein family. ALBA and YTHDF proteins physically associate via a deeply conserved short linear motif in the intrinsically disordered region of YTHDF proteins, their mRNA target sets overlap, and ALBA4 binding sites are juxtaposed to m 6 A sites. These binding sites correspond to pyrimidine-rich elements previously found to be important for m 6 A binding of ECT2. Accordingly, both biological functions of ECT2 and its binding to m 6 A targets in vivo require ALBA association. Our results introduce the YTHDF-ALBA complex as the functional cytoplasmic m 6 A-reader in plants and define a molecular foundation for the concept of facilitated m 6 A reading that increases the potential for combinatorial control of biological m 6 A effects.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4> The natural history and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, particularly during the autoantibody- positive stages preceding clinical onset, are not well understood, in part, due to limited availability of human pancreatic samples. Here, we studied 88 organ donors, including 28 single autoantibody-positive and 10 multiple autoantibody-positive donors, by imaging mass cytometry. Approximately 10,000 islets and 16 million single-cells were spatially analyzed using 79 antibodies revealing both β-cell states and the islet-immune interface. We identified IAPP loss from β-cells as an indicator of pre-clinical disease. Alterations in Interferon signatures and downregulation across lineage and functional markers, including markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, were characteristic of recent-onset disease. Further, in single autoantibody- positive donors, we identified pro-inflammatory myeloid cells and PD1 + memory CD4 + T cells, and in multiple autoantibody-positive samples, found islet-specific and exhausted-like ebector CD8 + T cells. Multiple immune cell subtypes were associated with young age, disease severity and insulitis. This dataset is a major step toward creation of a multi-modal type 1 diabetes disease atlas that will be useful for identifying potential drug targets and association of disease features with clinical co-variates and trial outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Pathological activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is among the most frequent defects in human cancer and is also the cause of rare overgrowth disorders. Yet, there is currently no systematic understanding of the quantitative flow of information within PI3K/AKT signaling and how it is perturbed by disease-causing mutations. Here, we develop scalable, single-cell approaches for systematic analyses of signal processing within the PI3K pathway, enabling precise calculations of its information transfer for different growth factors. Using genetically-engineered human cell models with allele dose-dependent expression of PIK3CA H1047R , we show that this oncogene is not a simple, constitutive pathway activator but a context-dependent modulator of extracellular signal transfer. PIK3CA H1047R reduces information transmission downstream of IGF1 while selectively enhancing EGF-induced signaling and transcriptional responses. This leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, akin to “blurred” signal perception. The associated increase in signaling heterogeneity promotes phenotypic diversity in a human cervical cancer cell line model and in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Collectively, these findings and the accompanying methodological advances lay the foundations for a systematic mapping of the quantitative mechanisms of PI3K/AKT-dependent signal processing and phenotypic control in health and disease. <h4>One-sentence summary</h4> Single-cell signaling and information theoretic analyses reveal that oncogenic PI3K/AKT activation leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, context-dependent EGF response amplification as well as increased phenotypic heterogeneity.",

      "title": "Atrial Proteomic Profiling Reveals a Switch Towards Profibrotic Gene Expression Program in CREM-IbΔC-X Mice with Persistent Atrial Fibrillation",
      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Background</h4> Overexpression of the CREM (cAMP response element-binding modulator) isoform CREM-IbΔC-X in transgenic mice (CREM-Tg) causes the age-dependent development of spontaneous AF. <h4>Purpose</h4> To identify key proteome signatures and biological processes accompanying the development of persistent AF through integrated proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. <h4>Methods</h4> Atrial tissue samples from three CREM-Tg mice and three wild-type littermates were subjected to unbiased mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 98 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for biological processes regulating actin cytoskeleton organization and extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. Changes in ITGAV, FBLN5, and LCP1 were identified as being relevant to atrial fibrosis and remodeling based on expression changes, co-expression patterns, and PPI network analysis. Comparative analysis with previously published datasets revealed a shift in protein expression patterns from ion-channel and metabolic regulators in young CREM-Tg mice to profibrotic remodeling factors in older CREM-Tg mice. Furthermore, older CREM-Tg mice exhibited protein expression patterns that resembled those of humans with persistent AF. <h4>Conclusions</h4> This study uncovered distinct temporal changes in atrial protein expression patterns with age in CREM-Tg mice consistent with the progressive evolution of AF. Future studies into the role of the key differentially abundant proteins identified in this study in AF progression may open new therapeutic avenues to control atrial fibrosis and substrate development in AF. <h4>Graphical abstract</h4> Graphical abstract summarizing key findings of this paper. The atrial proteome in 9-month-old CREM- Tg mice with chronic persistent AF (perAF) was compared with age-matched WT littermates. In addition, proteome changes in these old CREM-Tg mice were compared with proteome changes previously identified in young CREM-Tg mice with paroxysmal AF (pAF). Moreover, an interspecies comparison was performed between old CREM-Tg mice and human patients with perAF. The major findings are that in pAF, key changes were identified in proteins involved in metabolism, energy production, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation and growth. On the other hand, in mice and humans with perAF, key changes were found in the expression of proteins involved in collagen production, extracellular matrix remodeling, actin cytoskeleton organization, and tissue repair.",

      "title": "Human Brain Mapping of Homotopic Functional Affinity",
      "abstract": "Homotopic positions are defined as the two areas with opposite but equal horizonal coordinates in the standard symmetric brain space. Characterizing similarity between two homotopic areas, brain homotopy represents a typical feature of the two hemispheres for both structure and function. Functional homotopy provides important perspectives for understanding neural correlates of cognition and behavior. Despite the decisive role of spatial geometric constraints and homophilic attachment on the human connectome, traditional practices in mapping functional homotopy only considered the temporal correlations of functional timeseries between homotopic areas, but ignored the homophily factors in generative connectivity models. Here, we proposed a novel method for functional homotopy analysis, namely Homotopic Functional Affinity (HFA). This method quantifies the homotopic affinity as the cosine distance of the full-brain functional connectivity profiles or fingerprints between the homotopic areas. HFA captures both geometric constraints (homotopic location) and homophily (affinity) simultaneously. By leveraging the resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Chinese HCP (CHCP), we mapped the 700ms-2mm high spatiotemporal resolution HFA and evaluated its test-retest reliability with linear mixed models, exhibiting generally fair-to-substantial reliable measurements of individual differences in HFA. The lowest HFA observed in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) inspired to perform an edge-detection algorithm on its surface render and derived three clearly differentiable and adjacent TPJ subregions: the anterior TPJ (TPJa), the central TPJ (TPJc), and the posterior TPJ (TPJp). We further validated the HFA for the three TPJ regions through a set of comprehensive analyses, including the delineation of their functional connectivity fingerprints, the meta-analysis of their cognitive functions, and their task-activation correlation. Finally, we linked the cortical HFA map to those multimodal brain maps of gene expression, evolution, myelination, functional hierarchy, and cognitive association. The systematic subregion analysis revealed the complex hemispheric specialization of TPJ in attention, social cognition, and language functions. In general, functional specialization of the TPJ areas was stronger in the left hemisphere. The findings from the task activation correlation were highly consistent with those of the meta-analysis. Notably, there were significant differences in social cognition relevant to the three TPJ areas between HCP and CHCP datasets. Furthermore, the correlation analysis of multimodal brain maps illustrated a close relationship between the HFA map and multimodal brain maps. The consistency of maps derived in distinct analyses demonstrated the feasibility of HFA in further understanding psychological and behavioral mechanisms on neural lateralization from the perspective of hemispheric functional integration and specialization. In summary, the proposed HFA framework provides a reliable and valid functional brain mapping tool, with broad applicability in population neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over one million deaths thus far. There is an urgent need for the development of specific viral therapeutics and a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly expressed upon infection and is essential for viral replication, making it a promising target for both antiviral drug and vaccine development. Here, starting from a functional proteomics workflow, we initially catalogued the protein-protein interactions of 21 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in HEK293 cells, finding that the stress granule resident proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2 copurify with N with high specificity. We demonstrate that N protein expression in human cells sequesters G3BP1 and G3BP2 through its physical interaction with these proteins, attenuating stress granule (SG) formation. The ectopic expression of G3BP1 in N-expressing cells was sufficient to reverse this phenotype. Since N is an RNA-binding protein, we performed iCLIP-sequencing experiments in cells, with or without exposure to oxidative stress, to identify the host RNAs targeted by N. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 N protein binds directly to thousands of mRNAs under both conditions. Like the G3BPs stress granule proteins, N was found to predominantly bind its target mRNAs in their 3’UTRs. RNA sequencing experiments indicated that expression of N results in wide-spread gene expression changes in both unstressed and oxidatively stressed cells. We suggest that N regulates host gene expression by both attenuating stress granules and binding directly to target mRNAs.",

      "abstract": "The transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments represents a major evolutionary transition in animals, requiring significant adaptations in physiology and defense mechanisms to the challenges presented by the harsh terrestrial environment. Platyhelminthes, which include both aquatic and terrestrial species with a single terrestrialization event in the family Geoplaniidae, serve as excellent model organisms for studying the evolutionary adaptations required for terrestrialization. This study investigates the evolutionary dynamics of toxin orthologous groups (as a proxy to gene families) in aquatic and terrestrial flatworms, together with mucus composition, focusing on their role in terrestrialization from a molecular ecology perspective. Using a proteo-transcriptomic approach, we predicted and identified a broader toxin gene repertoire in terrestrial flatworms compared to freshwater ones. Although most toxins in flatworms arose before terrestrial planarian diversification—gaining a novel evolutionary origin at the Tricladida and Continenticola nodes—the mucus protein repertoire appears to have a far older evolutionary origin in both species. Moreover, distinct orthologous groups underpin the toxin gene repertoire and mucus composition in each lineage, highlighting the contrasting evolutionary trajectories of these two functional components. While toxin families in both aquatic and terrestrial flatworms revealed overall common functions, including cytokine modulation and ion channel regulation, terrestrial flatworms exhibited specific expansions of lectin-like proteins and pro-inflammatory responses, highlighting their potential key role to respond to land-based threats. This study provides new insights into the differential evolutionary trajectories of toxin and mucus proteins in planarians, offering a deeper understanding of the genetic innovations that facilitated flatworm terrestrialization.",

We show that A/U-rich 3’UTR termini serve as hubs for poised PABP binding to license selective mRNA decay. Timing of decay is coupled to embryo implantation via ERK/MEK phosphorylation of LIN28A, repositioning pLIN28A to the PABP-RNA hubs at 3’UTR termini. Multivalency of AUU-motifs determines the efficacy of pLIN28A-PABP convergence, enhancing PABP 3’UTR binding selectively, decreasing the protection of polyA tails and activating mRNA decay to enable progression towards primed pluripotency. Collectively, PABP-RNA hubs are poised for signal-induced convergence with the regulator LIN28A, which selects naïve mRNAs for decay, thus enabling the switch-like capacity of its phosphorylation in ensuring swift developmental progression.</p>",

      "abstract": "Protein language models (PLMs) capture features of protein three-dimensional structure from amino acid sequences alone, without requiring multiple sequence alignments (MSA). The concepts of grammar and semantics from natural language have the potential to capture functional properties of proteins. Here, we investigate how these representations enable assessment of variation due to mutation. Applied to SARS-CoV-2's spike protein using in silico deep mutational scanning (DMS) we demonstrate the PLM, ESM-2, has learned the sequence context within which variation occurs, capturing evolutionary constraint. This recapitulates what conventionally requires MSA data to predict. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods which require protein structures or multiple sequences for training, we show what can be accomplished using an unmodified pretrained PLM. We demonstrate that the grammaticality and semantic scores represent novel metrics. Applied to SARS-CoV-2 variants across the pandemic we show that ESM-2 representations encode the evolutionary history between variants, as well as the distinct nature of variants of concern upon their emergence, associated with shifts in receptor binding and antigenicity. PLM likelihoods can also identify epistatic interactions among sites in the protein. Our results here affirm that PLMs are broadly useful for variant-effect prediction, including unobserved changes, and can be applied to understand novel viral pathogens with the potential to be applied to any protein sequence, pathogen or otherwise.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how mutations affect protein function remains critical yet challenging, particularly for variants in clinical databases lacking experimental characterisation and for intrinsically disordered regions. Current computational approaches often operate as black boxes, providing predictions without sufficient transparency or quality assessment of the underlying data. Here we present ProteoCast, a user-friendly web server that predicts variant effects through evolutionary constraint analysis and structural context integration. ProteoCast provides a three-tier variant classification (impactful, mild, neutral) to help prioritise mutations for clinical interpretation and experimental validation. It incorporates multiple sequence alignment quality controls to ensure prediction reliability and flag positions with insufficient evolutionary information. Beyond single-variant classification, ProteoCast employs a novel segmentation approach based on mutational sensitivity to identify functional linear peptides in disordered regions. Interactive visualisations guide users through results interpretation, from variant-level predictions to protein-wide functional landscapes. Evaluation on ~63,000 ClinVar variants demonstrates 77% sensitivity and 87% specificity for pathogenicity prediction, with performance maintained across species (85% accuracy on Drosophila lethal mutations). ProteoCast successfully identifies twice as many functional motifs in intrinsically disordered regions compared to conservation-based phylogenetic methods. Predictions can be tuned to specific conformations, such as bound forms in protein complexes, for improved accuracy and interpretability. With its transparent, unsupervised methodology and computational efficiency (minutes per protein), ProteoCast democratises access to variant effect prediction and functional site discovery for the broader research community.

      "abstract": "Deciphering the brain’s structure-function relationship is key to understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying perception and cognition. The cortical column, a vertical organization of neurons with similar functions, is a classic example of primate neocortex structure-function organization. While columns have been identified in primary sensory areas using parametric stimuli, their prevalence across higher-level cortex is debated, particularly regarding complex tuning in natural image space. However, a key hurdle in identifying columns is characterizing the complex, nonlinear tuning of neurons to high-dimensional sensory inputs. Building on prior findings of topological organization for features like color and orientation, we investigate functional clustering in macaque visual area V4 in non-parametric natural image space, using large-scale recordings and deep learning–based analysis. We combined linear probe recordings with deep learning methods to systematically characterize the tuning of >1,200 V4 neurons using  in silico synthesis of most exciting images (MEIs), followed by  in vivo verification. Single V4 neurons exhibited MEIs containing complex features, including textures and shapes, and even high-level attributes with eye-like appearance. Neurons recorded on the same silicon probe, inserted orthogonal to the cortical surface, often exhibited similarities in their spatial feature selectivity, suggesting a degree of functional organization along the cortical depth. We quantified MEI similarity using human psychophysics and distances in a contrastive learning-derived embedding space. Moreover, the selectivity of the V4 neuronal population showed evidence of clustering into functional groups of shared feature selectivity. These functional groups showed parallels with the feature maps of units in artificial vision systems, suggesting potential shared encoding strategies. These results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of deep learning–based functional characterization of neuronal selectivity in naturalistic visual contexts, offering a framework for quantitatively mapping cortical organization across multiple levels of the visual hierarchy.",

      "abstract": "Pathogen and pest effectors play a crucial role in manipulating plant biological processes, facilitating infection and infestation. While pathogens and pests secrete repertoires of effectors into their host plants, most effector function studies focus on characterising individual proteins. We previously identified a genetically linked and co-regulated gene pair in the aphid Myzus persicae encoding effectors Mp1 and Mp58. Here, we explored the functional link between these effectors. We used ectopic expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana followed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and confocal microscopy to explore effector-effector and effector-target interactions and their subcellular localisation. We produced recombinant proteins to validate effector interactions and used computational modelling to predict effector complex 3D structures. We revealed that effectors Mp1 and Mp58 interact in planta and in vitro and likely form an oligomeric complex. Both effectors associate with the host target Vacuolar Protein Sorting associated Protein 52 (VPS52) to form an Mp1-Mp58-VPS52 complex which localises at vesicle-like structures. Our findings point to effector complex formation in plant-insect interactions and highlight a further layer of complexity in the molecular dialogue between plants and insects. Our work also shows the importance of considering the context in which effectors may function within a larger effector repertoire.",

      "abstract": "<h4> Abstract </h4> Evidence accumulation is a fundamental neural computation essential for adaptive behavior, yet its synaptic implementation remains unclear. Addressing this challenge critically depends on linking neural dynamics to circuit structure within the same brain. Here, we combine functional calcium imaging with large-scale ultrastructural electron microscopy (EM) to uncover the wiring logic of visual evidence accumulation in larval zebrafish. In a functionally imaged EM dataset of the anterior hindbrain, we identify conserved morphological cell types whose activity patterns define distinct computational roles. Bilateral inhibition, disinhibition, and recurrent connectivity emerge as key circuit motifs shaping these dynamics. To generalize our findings across animals, we develop a photoconversion-based pipeline to label and reconstruct functionally characterized neurons, enabling us to train a classifier that predicts functional identity from morphology alone. Applying this classifier to a second, whole-brain EM dataset lacking functional data reveals matching connectivity patterns, significantly augmenting its applicability for detailed circuit dissections. Based on these results, we develop and constrain a biophysically realistic neural network model that captures observed dynamics and yields predictions we tested and confirmed experimentally. Our work illustrates how hypothesis-driven connectomics can uncover the synaptic basis of sensory-motor computations and establishes a novel framework for cross-animal circuit dissection in the vertebrate brain.",

For each dye, we obtain nanomolar binders with weak or no binding to the other two dyes; the accuracy of the design approach is confirmed by a crystal structure of one binder which is very close to the design model. Fusion of the JF567, JF596 and JF494 binders to three different targets followed by staining with the three dyes simultaneously enables multiplex imaging. We further expand functionality by incorporating an active site carrying out nucleophilic aromatic substitution to form a covalent linkage with the dye, and developing split versions which reconstitute fluorescence at subcellular locations where both halves are present, enabling both protein-protein interaction detection and chemically induced dimerization with fluorescence reporting. Our designs combine the advantages of fluorescent proteins and small molecule dyes and should be broadly useful for cellular imaging.",

      "abstract": "The amount of grey literature and ‘softer’ intelligence from social media or websites is vast. Given the long lead-times of producing high-quality peer-reviewed health information this is causing a demand for new ways to provide prompt input for secondary research. To our knowledge this is the first review of automated data extraction methods or tools for health-related grey literature and soft intelligence, with a focus on (semi)automating horizon scans, health technology assessments, evidence maps, or other literature reviews. We searched six databases to cover both health– and computer-science literature. After deduplication, 10% of the search results were screened by two reviewers, the remainder was single-screened up to an estimated 95% sensitivity; screening was stopped early after screening an additional 1000 results with no new includes. All full texts were retrieved, screened, and extracted by a single reviewer and 10% were checked in duplicate. We included 84 papers covering automation for health-related social media, internet fora, news, patents, government agencies and charities, or trial registers. From each paper we answered three research questions: Firstly, important functionalities for users of the tool or method; secondly, information about the level of support and reliability; and thirdly, practical challenges and research gaps. Poor availability of code, data, and usable tools leads to low transparency regarding performance and duplication of work. Financial implications, scalability, integration into downstream workflows, and meaningful evaluations should be carefully planned before starting to develop a tool, given the vast amounts of data and opportunities those tools offer to expedite research.",

      "title": "Improved estimation of molecular evolution coupling stochastic simulations and deep learning",
      "abstract": "Models have always been central to inferring molecular evolution and to reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Their use typically involves the development of a mechanistic framework reflecting our understanding of the underlying biological processes, such as nucleotide substitutions, and the estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. However, deriving and optimizing the likelihood of the data is not always possible under complex evolutionary scenarios or tractable for large datasets, often leading to unrealistic simplifying assumptions in the fitted models. To overcome this issue, we couple stochastic simulations of genome evolution with a new supervised deep learning model to infer key parameters of molecular evolution. Our model is designed to directly analyze multiple sequence alignments and estimate per-site evolutionary rates and divergence, without requiring a known phylogenetic tree. The accuracy of our predictions matches that of likelihood-based phylogenetic inference, when rate heterogeneity follows a simple gamma distribution, but it strongly exceeds it under more complex patterns of rate variation, such as codon models. Our approach is highly scalable and can be efficiently applied to genomic data, as we show on a dataset of 26 million nucleotides from the clownfish clade. Our simulations also show that the per-site rates obtained by deep learning increase the likelihood of the true tree and could therefore lead to more accurate phylogenetic inference. We propose that future advancements in phylogenetic analysis will benefit from a semi-supervised learning approach that combines deep-learning estimation of substitution rates, which allows for more flexible models of rate variation, and probabilistic inference of the phylogenetic tree, which guarantees interpretability and a rigorous assessments of statistical support.",

      "abstract": "Correlative light and volume electron microscopy (vCLEM) is a powerful imaging technique that enables the visualisation of fluorescently labelled proteins within their ultrastructural context on a subcellular level. Currently, expert microscopists align vCLEM acquisitions using time-consuming and subjective manual methods. This paper presents CLEM-Reg, an algorithm that automates the 3D alignment of vCLEM datasets by leveraging probabilistic point cloud registration techniques. These point clouds are derived from segmentations of common structures in each modality, created by state-of-the-art open-source methods, with the option to leverage alternative tools from other plugins or platforms. CLEM-Reg drastically reduces the time required to register vCLEM datasets to a few minutes and achieves correlation of fluorescent signal to sub-micron target structures in EM on three newly acquired vCLEM benchmark datasets (fluorescence microscopy combined with FIB-SEM or SBF-SEM). CLEM-Reg was then used to automatically obtain vCLEM overlays to unambiguously identify TGN46-positive transport carriers involved in the trafficking of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane. The datasets are available in the EMPIAR and BioStudies public image archives for reuse in testing and developing multimodal registration algorithms by the wider community. A napari plugin integrating the algorithm is also provided to aid end-user adoption.",

      "abstract": "Antigen presentation on MHC class I (MHC-I) is key to the adaptive immune response to cancerous cells. Computational prediction of peptide presentation by MHC-I has enabled individualized cancer immunotherapies. Here, we introduce HLApollo, a transformer-based approach with end-to-end modeling of MHC-I sequence, deconvolution, and flanking sequences. To achieve this, we develop a novel training strategy, negative set switching, which greatly reduces overfitting to falsely presumed negatives that are necessarily found in presentation datasets. HLApollo shows a meaningful improvement compared to recent MHC-I models on peptide presentation (20.19% average precision (AP)) and immunogenicity (4.1% AP). As expected, adding gene expression boosts the performance of HLApollo. More interestingly, we show that introduction of features from a protein language model, ESM 1b, remarkably recoups much of the benefits of gene expression in absence of true expression measurements. Finally, we demonstrate excellent pan-allelic generalization, and introduce a framework for estimating the expected accuracy of HLApollo for untrained alleles. This guides the use of HLApollo in a clinical setting, where rare alleles may be observed in some subjects, particularly for underrepresented minorities.",

      "title": "Molecular signatures of cortical expansion in the human fetal brain",
      "abstract": "The third trimester of human gestation is characterised by rapid increases in brain volume and cortical surface area. A growing catalogue of cells in the prenatal brain has revealed remarkable molecular diversity across cortical areas. 1,2 Despite this, little is known about how this translates into the patterns of differential cortical expansion observed in humans during the latter stages of gestation. Here we present a new resource, μBrain, to facilitate knowledge translation between molecular and anatomical descriptions of the prenatal developing brain. Built using generative artificial intelligence, μBrain is a three-dimensional cellular-resolution digital atlas combining publicly-available serial sections of the postmortem human brain at 21 weeks gestation 3 with bulk tissue microarray data, sampled across 29 cortical regions and 5 transient tissue zones. 4 Using μBrain, we evaluate the molecular signatures of preferentially-expanded cortical regions during human gestation, quantified in utero using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We find that differences in the rates of expansion across cortical areas during gestation respect anatomical and evolutionary boundaries between cortical types 5 and are founded upon extended periods of upper-layer cortical neuron migration that continue beyond mid-gestation. We identify a set of genes that are upregulated from mid-gestation and highly expressed in rapidly expanding neocortex, which are implicated in genetic disorders with cognitive sequelae. Our findings demonstrate a spatial coupling between areal differences in the timing of neurogenesis and rates of expansion across the neocortical sheet during the prenatal epoch. The μBrain atlas is available from: https://garedaba.github.io/micro-brain/ and provides a new tool to comprehensively map early brain development across domains, model systems and resolution scales.",

      "title": "Genetic Distinctions Between Reticular Pseudodrusen and Drusen: Insights from a Genome-Wide Association Study",
      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4> To explore genetic determinants specific to reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), and to compare these with genetic associations for drusen. <h4>Setting</h4> Participants with RPD, drusen, or controls from the UK Biobank (UKBB), a large, multisite, community-based cohort study. <h4>Methods</h4> A previously validated deep learning framework was deployed on 169,370 optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes from the UKBB to identify cases with RPD and/or drusen and controls without these phenotypes. Cases were included if they were 60 years or older, with at least 5 lesions. Five retina specialists manually validated the cohorts using OCT and color fundus photographs. Quantifications of RPD and drusen derived by the framework were used as variables. Two primary genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were performed to explore potential genetic associations with number of RPD and drusen within ‘pure’ cases, where only RPD or drusen were present in either eye. A candidate approach was furthermore adopted to assess 46 previously known AMD loci. Secondary GWAS were undertaken for number of RPD and drusen in mixed cases, as well as binary case-control analyses for pure RPD and pure drusen. Genome-wide significance was defined as p<5e-8. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 1,787 participants were identified and analysed, including 1,037 controls, 361 pure drusen, 66 pure RPD and 323 mixed cases. The primary pure RPD GWAS yielded four genome-wide significant loci: rs11200630/ ARMS2-HTRA1 (p=1.9e-09), rs79641866/ PARD3B on chromosome 2 (p=1.3e-08), rs143184903/ ITPR1 on chromosome 3 (p=8.1e-09), and rs76377757/ SLN on chromosome 11 (p=4.3e-08). The latter three are all uncommon variants (minor allele frequency <5%). A significant association at CFH was also observed adopting a candidate approach (p=1.8e-04). Two loci reached genome-wide significance for the primary pure drusen GWAS: rs10801555/ CFH on chromosome 1 (p=6.0e-33) and rs61871744/ ARMS2-HTRA1 on chromosome 10 (p=4.2e-20). For the mixed RPD and drusen secondary analyses, lead variants at both the CFH and ARMS2-HTRA1 loci reached genome-wide significance, with C2-CFB-SKIV2L additionally associated for mixed drusen alone. Findings from the binary case-control GWAS for drusen mirrored those of the primary drusen analysis, however no variants reached genome-wide significance in the case-control RPD GWAS. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our findings indicate a clear association between the ARMS2 - HTRA1 locus with higher RPD load. Although the association at the CFH locus did not reach genome-wide significance, we observed a suggestive link. We furthermore identified three novel associations that are unique to RPD, albeit for uncommon genetic variants. These findings were only observable when quantifying RPD load as a continuous trait, which increased the study’s statistical power. Further studies with larger sample sizes are now required to explore the relative contributions of AMRS2-HTRA1 and CFH to RPD development, and to explore the validity of these newly presented RPD-specific genetic associations.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to rapidly mutate and change in ways that impact virulence, transmissibility, and immune evasion. Genome sequencing is a critical tool, as other biological techniques can be more costly, time-consuming, and difficult. However, the rapid and complex evolution of SARS-CoV-2 challenges conventional sequence analysis methods like phylogenetic analysis. The virus picks up and loses mutations independently in multiple subclades, often in novel or unexpected combinations, and, as for the newly emerged Omicron variant, sometimes with long explained branches. We propose interpretable deep sequence models trained by machine learning to complement conventional methods. We apply Transformer-based neural network models developed for natural language processing to analyze protein sequences. We add network layers to generate sample embeddings and sequence-wide attention to interpret models and visualize multiscale patterns. We demonstrate and validate our framework by modeling SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus taxonomy. We then develop an interpretable predictive model of disease severity that integrates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence and patient demographic variables, using publicly available data from the GISAID database. We also apply our model to Omicron. Based on knowledge prior to the availability of empirical data for Omicron, we predict: 1) reduced neutralization antibody activity (15-50 fold) greater than any previously characterized variant, varying between Omicron sublineages, and 2) reduced risk of severe disease (by 35-40%) relative to Delta. Both predictions are in accord with recent epidemiological and experimental data.",

      "title": "Flexible and Highly-Efficient Feature Perception for Molecular Traits Prediction via Self-interactive Deep Learning",
      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Predicting disease-related molecular traits from histomorphology brings great opportunities for precision medicine. Despite the rich information present in histopathological images, extracting fine-grained molecular features from standard whole slide images (WSI) is non-trivial. The task is further complicated by the lack of annotations for subtyping and contextual histomorphological features that might span multiple scales. This work proposes a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework capable of WSI-based cancer morpho-molecular subtyping across scales. Our method, debuting as Inter-MIL, follows a weakly-supervised scheme. It enables the training of the patch-level encoder for WSI in a task-aware optimisation procedure, a step normally improbable in most existing MIL-based WSI analysis frameworks. We demonstrate that optimising the patch-level encoder is crucial to achieving high-quality fine-grained and tissue-level subtyping results and offers a significant improvement over task-agnostic encoders. Our approach deploys a pseudo-label propagation strategy to update the patch encoder iteratively, allowing discriminative subtype features to be learned. This mechanism also empowers extracting fine-grained attention within image tiles (the small patches), a task largely ignored in most existing weakly supervised-based frameworks. With Inter-MIL, we carried out four challenging cancer molecular subtyping tasks in the context of ovarian, colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. Extensive evaluation results show that Inter-MIL is a robust framework for cancer morpho-molecular subtyping with superior performance compared to several recently proposed methods, even in data-limited scenarios where the number of available training slides is less than 100. The iterative optimisation mechanism of Inter-MIL significantly improves the quality of the image features learned by the patch embedded and generally directs the attention map to areas that better align with experts’ interpretation, leading to the identification of more reliable histopathology biomarkers.",

Here, we employed a multimodal imaging approach to assess oxygenation changes in the spinal cord of a transgenic M83 murine model of PD in comparison to non-transgenic littermates at 9-12 months-of-age. A lower oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) SVOT was detected in vivo with spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography (SVOT) in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared to non-transgenic littermate mice. Ex-vivo high-field T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunostaining for alpha-synuclein (phospho-S129) and vascular organisation (CD31 and GLUT1) were used to investigate the nature of the abnormalities detected via in vivo imaging. Ex-vivo analysis showed that the vascular network in the spinal cord was not impaired in the spinal cord of M83 mice. Ex-vivo MRI assisted with deep learning-based automatic segmentation showed no volumetric atrophy in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared to non-transgenic littermates, whereas nuclear alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 site could be linked to early pathology and metabolic dysfunction. The proposed and validated non-invasive high-resolution imaging tool to study oxygen saturation in the spinal cord of PD mice holds promise for assessing early changes preceding motor deficits in PD mice.",

We identified 70 HFrEF and 10 HFpEF gene-hits, of which 58 are novel. In 14 known loci for unclassified HF, we identified HFrEF as the subtype responsible for the signal. HFrEF hits ZBTB17 , MTSS1 , PDLIM5 , and MLIP and novel HFpEF hits NFATC2IP, and PABPC4 showed robustness to MR assumptions, support from orthogonal sources, compelling evidence on mechanism of action needed for therapeutic efficacy, and no evidence of an unacceptable safety profile. We strengthen the value of pathways such as ubiquitin-proteasome system, small ubiquitin-related modifier pathway, inflammation, and mitochondrial metabolism as potential therapeutic targets for HF management. We identified IL6R , ADM, and EDNRA as suggestive hits for HFrEF and LPA for HFrEF and HFpEF, which enhances the odds of success for existing cardiovascular investigational drugs targeting. These findings confirm the unique value of human genetic studies in HFrEF and HFpEF for discovery of novel targets and generation of therapeutic target profiles needed to initiate new validation programs in HFrEF and HFpEF preclinical models.",

      "title": "QUICHE reveals structural definitions of anti-tumor responses in triple negative breast cancer",
      "abstract": "While recent innovations in spatial biology have driven new insights into how tissue organization is altered in disease, interpreting these datasets in a generalized and scalable fashion remains a challenge. Computational workflows for discovering condition-specific differences in tissue organization typically rely on pairwise comparisons or unsupervised clustering. In many cases, these approaches are computationally expensive, lack statistical rigor, and are insensitive to low-prevalence cellular niches that are nevertheless highly discriminative and predictive of patient outcomes. Here, we present QUICHE – an automated, scalable, and statistically robust method that can be used to discover cellular niches differentially enriched in spatial regions, longitudinal samples, or clinical patient groups. In contrast to existing methods, QUICHE combines local niche detection with interpretable statistical modeling using graph neighborhoods to detect differentially enriched cellular niches, even at low prevalence. Using in silico models and spatial proteomic imaging of human tissues, we demonstrate that QUICHE can accurately detect condition-specific cellular niches occurring at a frequency of 0.5% in fewer than 20% of patient samples, outperforming the next best method which required a patient prevalence of 60% for detection. To validate our approach and understand how tumor structure influences recurrence risk in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we used QUICHE to comprehensively profile the tumor microenvironment in a multi-center, spatial proteomics cohort consisting of primary surgical resections, analyzing over 2 million cells from 314 patients across 5 medical centers. We discovered cellular niches that were consistently enriched in key regions of the tumor microenvironment, including the tumor-immune border and extracellular matrix remodeling regions, as well as niches statistically-associated with patient outcomes, including recurrence status and recurrence-free survival. The majority of differential niches (74.2%) were specific to patients that did not relapse and formed a robust interconnected network enriched in monocytes, macrophages, APCs, and CD8T cells with tumor and stroma cells. In contrast, the interaction network for patients that relapsed was notably sparse and enriched in B cells, CD68 macrophages and neutrophils. We validated these findings using two independent cohorts, observing similar cellular interactions and predictive power. Collectively, these results suggest that salient, generalized profiles of productive anti-tumor immune responses are defined by a network of structural engagement between innate and adaptive immunity with tumor and stromal cells, rather than by any single specific cell population. We have made QUICHE freely available as a user-friendly open-source Python package at https://github.com/jranek/quiche .",

Density assessed by radiologists using visual analogue scales has been shown to provide better risk predictions than other methods. Our purpose is to build automated models using deep learning and train on radiologist scores to make accurate and consistent predictions. <h4>Approach</h4> We used a data-set of almost 160,000 mammograms each with two independent density scores made by expert medical practitioners. We used two pre-trained deep networks and adapted them to produce feature vectors which were then used for both linear and non-linear regression to make density predictions. We also simulated an “optimal method” which allowed us to compare the quality of our results with a simulated upper bound on performance. <h4>Results</h4> Our deep learning method produced estimates with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 8.79 ± 0.21. The model estimates of cancer risk perform at a similar level to human experts, within uncertainty bounds. We made comparisons between different model variants and demonstrated the high level of consistency of the model predictions. Our modelled “optimal method” produced image predictions with a RMSE of between 7.98 and 8.90 for cranial caudal images. <h4>Conclusion</h4> We demonstrated a new deep learning framework based upon a transfer learning approach to make density estimates based on radiologists’ visual scores.

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly worldwide, leading to a global outbreak. Most governments, enterprises, and scientific research institutions are participating in the COVID-19 struggle to curb the spread of the pandemic. As a powerful tool against COVID-19, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are widely used in combating this pandemic. In this survey, we investigate the main scope and contributions of AI in combating COVID-19 from the aspects of disease detection and diagnosis, virology and pathogenesis, drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and transmission prediction. In addition, we summarize the available data and resources that can be used for AI-based COVID-19 research. Finally, the main challenges and potential directions of AI in fighting against COVID-19 are discussed. Currently, AI mainly focuses on medical image inspection, genomics, drug development, and transmission prediction, and thus AI still has great potential in this field. This survey presents medical and AI researchers with a comprehensive view of the existing and potential applications of AI technology in combating COVID-19 with the goal of inspiring researchers to continue to maximize the advantages of AI and big data to fight COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> The rapid growth of inherently complex and heterogeneous data in HIV/AIDS research underscores the importance of Big Data Science. Recently, there have been increasing uptakes of Big Data techniques in basic, clinical, and public health fields of HIV/AIDS research. However, no studies have systematically elaborated on the evolving applications of Big Data in HIV/AIDS research. We sought to explore the emergence and evolution of Big Data Science in HIV/AIDS-related publications that were funded by the US federal agencies. <h4>Methods</h4> We identified HIV/AIDS and Big Data related publications that were funded by seven federal agencies from 2000 to 2019 by integrating data from National Institutes of Health (NIH) ExPORTER, MEDLINE, and MeSH. Building on bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we constructed co-occurrence networks using bibliographic metadata (e.g., countries, institutes, MeSH terms, and keywords) of the retrieved publications. We then detected clusters among the networks as well as the temporal dynamics of clusters, followed by expert evaluation and clinical implications. <h4>Results</h4> We harnessed nearly 600 thousand publications related to HIV/AIDS, of which 19,528 publications relating to Big Data were included in bibliometric analysis. Results showed that (1) the number of Big Data publications has been increasing since 2000, (2) US institutes have been in close collaborations with China, Canada, and Germany, (3) some institutes (e.g., University of California system, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Harvard Medical School) are among the most productive institutes and started using Big Data in HIV/AIDS research early, (4) Big Data research was not active in public health disciplines until 2015, (5) research topics such as genomics, HIV comorbidities, population-based studies, Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, precision medicine, and methodologies such as machine learning, Deep Learning, radiomics, and data mining emerge quickly in recent years. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We identified a rapid growth in the cross-disciplinary research of HIV/AIDS and Big Data over the past two decades. Our findings demonstrated patterns and trends of prevailing research topics and Big Data applications in HIV/AIDS research and suggested a number of fast-evolving areas of Big Data Science in HIV/AIDS research including secondary analysis of EHR, machine learning, Deep Learning, predictive analysis, and NLP.",

Anticoagulant prescribing decisions in atrial fibrillation (AF) offer a use case where the benchmark stroke risk prediction tool (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) could be meaningfully improved by including more information from a patient’s medical history. In this study, we design and build the first DL and ML pipeline that uses the routinely updated, linked EHR data for 56 million people in England accessed via NHS Digital to predict first ischaemic stroke in people with AF, and as a secondary outcome, COVID-19 death. Our pipeline improves first stroke prediction in AF by 17% compared to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (0.61 (0.57-0.65) vs 0.52 (0.52-0.52) area under the receiver operating characteristics curves, 95% confidence interval) and provides a generalisable, opensource framework that other researchers and developers can build on.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the development of accurate diagnostics in order to control and minimize viral propagation; however, accurate and remote means of COVID-19 diagnosis have yet to be developed. The objective of this research was to explore the potential of external eye imaging and machine learning (ML) algorithms for early COVID-19 diagnosis via a patent-pending protocol known as iDetect. iDetect employs deep learning techniques to analyze external eye images captured using mobile eye imaging devices. Images were collected through rigorous data collection procedures, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and image acquisition from participants in multiple countries. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) analysis was utilized for ML model interpretability. The developed convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) models demonstrated high diagnostic performance, with the CNN models achieving an area-under-receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 92% and exhibiting sensitivity and specificity values exceeding 90% in most eye positions. The SVM models also showed promising performance, with an AUROC of 89%. The findings of this study present a practical and scalable solution for accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, contributing to ongoing efforts to explore innovative diagnostic methods and enhance early detection and management of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Viral infections represent a major health concern worldwide. The alarming rate at which SARS-CoV-2 spreads, for example, led to a worldwide pandemic. Viruses incorporate genetic material into the host genome to hijack host cell functions such as the cell cycle and apoptosis. In these viral processes, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play critical roles. Therefore, the identification of PPIs between humans and viruses is crucial for understanding the infection mechanism and host immune responses to viral infections and for discovering effective drugs. Experimental methods such as yeast two-hybrid assays and mass spectrometry are widely used to identify human-virus PPIs, but these experimental methods are time-consuming, expensive, and laborious. To overcome this problem, we developed a novel computational predictor, named cross-attention PHV, by implementing two key technologies of the cross-attention mechanism and a one- dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). The cross-attention mechanisms were very effective in enhancing prediction and generalization abilities. Application of 1D-CNN to the word2vec-generated feature matrices reduced computational costs, thus extending the allowable length of protein sequences to 9000 amino acid residues. Cross- attention PHV outperformed existing state-of-the-art models using a benchmark dataset and accurately predicted PPIs for unknown viruses. Cross-attention PHV also predicted human–SARS-CoV-2 PPIs with area under the curve values >0.95.",

      "abstract": "The human neocortex consists of tangentially organized layers with unique cytoarchitectural properties. These layers show spatial variations in thickness and cytoarchitecture across the neocortex, which is thought to support brain function through enabling targeted corticocortical connections. Here, leveraging maps of the six cortical layers in 3D human brain histology, we aimed to quantitatively characterize the systematic covariation of laminar structure in the cortex and its functional consequences. After correcting for the effect of cortical curvature, we identified a spatial pattern of changes in laminar thickness covariance from lateral frontal to posterior occipital regions, which differentiated the dominance of infra- versus supragranular layer thickness. Corresponding to the laminar regularities of cortical connections along cortical hierarchy, the infragranular-dominant pattern of laminar thickness was associated with higher hierarchical positions of regions, mapped based on resting-state effective connectivity in humans and tract-tracing of structural connections in macaques. Moreover, we show that regions with comparable laminar thickness patterns correspond to inter-regional structural covariance, maturational coupling, and transcriptomic patterning, indicating developmental relevance. In sum, here we characterize the association between organization of laminar thickness and processing hierarchy, anchored in ontogeny. As such, we illustrate how laminar organization may provide a foundational principle ultimately supporting human cognitive functioning.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of disease-related death worldwide, and machine learning-based identification of novel biomarkers is crucial for improving early detection and treatment of various cancers. A key challenge in applying machine learning to high-dimensional data is deriving important features in an interpretable manner to provide meaningful insights into the underlying biological mechanisms We developed a class-based directional feature importance (CLIFI) metric for decision tree methods and demonstrated its use for the The Cancer Genome Atlas proteomics data. We incorporated this metric into four algorithms, Random Forest (RF), LAtent VAriable Stochastic Ensemble of Trees (LAVASET), and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), and a new extension incorporating the LAVA step into GBDTs (LAVABOOST). Both LAVA methods incorporate topological information from protein interactions into the decision function. The different models’ performance in classifying 28 cancers resulted in F1-scores of 93% (RF), 92% (LAVASET), 89% (LAVABOOST) and 86% (GBDT), with no method outperforming all others for individual cancer type prediction. The CLIFI metric allowed the visualisation of the model decision making functions, and the distributions indicated heterogeneity in several proteins (MYH11, ER α , BCL2) for different cancer types (including brain glioma, breast, kidney, thyroid and prostate cancer). We have developed an integrated, directional feature importance metric for multi-class decision tree-based classification models that facilitates interpretable feature importance assessment. The CLIFI metric can be used in conjunction with incorporating topological information into the decision functions of models to add inductive bias for improved interpretability. <h4>Availability</h4> All codes are available for data curation from https://github.com/EloisaRL/TCGA-proteomics-pipeline and the LAVASET (v1.0) package from https://github.com/melkasapi/LAVASET .",

      "title": "A systematic evaluation of deep learning methods for the prediction of drug synergy in cancer",
      "abstract": "One of the main obstacles to the successful treatment of cancer is the phenomenon of drug resistance. A common strategy to overcome resistance is the use of combination therapies. However, the space of possibilities is huge and efficient search strategies are required. Machine Learning (ML) can be a useful tool for the discovery of novel, clinically relevant anti-cancer drug combinations. In particular, deep learning (DL) has become a popular choice for modeling drug combination effects. Here, we set out to examine the impact of different methodological choices on the performance of multimodal DL-based drug synergy prediction methods, including the use of different input data types, preprocessing steps and model architectures. Focusing on the NCI ALMANAC dataset, we found that feature selection based on prior biological knowledge has a positive impact on performance. Drug features appeared to be more predictive of drug response. Molecular fingerprint-based drug representations performed slightly better than learned representations, and gene expression data of cancer or drug response-specific genes also improved performance. In general, fully connected feature-encoding subnetworks outperformed other architectures, with DL outperforming other ML methods. Using a state-of-the-art interpretability method, we showed that DL models can learn to associate drug and cell line features with drug response in a biologically meaningful way. The strategies explored in this study will help to improve the development of computational methods for the rational design of effective drug combinations for cancer therapy. <h4>Author summary</h4> Cancer therapies often fail because tumor cells become resistant to treatment. One way to overcome resistance is by treating patients with a combination of two or more drugs. Some combinations may be more effective than when considering individual drug effects, a phenomenon called drug synergy. Computational drug synergy prediction methods can help to identify new, clinically relevant drug combinations. In this study, we developed several deep learning models for drug synergy prediction. We examined the effect of using different types of deep learning architectures, and different ways of representing drugs and cancer cell lines. We explored the use of biological prior knowledge to select relevant cell line features, and also tested data-driven feature reduction methods. We tested both precomputed drug features and deep learning methods that can directly learn features from raw representations of molecules. We also evaluated whether including genomic features, in addition to gene expression data, improves the predictive performance of the models. Through these experiments, we were able to identify strategies that will help guide the development of new deep learning models for drug synergy prediction in the future.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth the importance of epidemic forecasting for decision makers in multiple domains, ranging from public health to the economy as a whole. While forecasting epidemic progression is frequently conceptualized as being analogous to weather forecasting, however it has some key differences and remains a non-trivial task. The spread of diseases is subject to multiple confounding factors spanning human behavior, pathogen dynamics, weather and environmental conditions. Research interest has been fueled by the increased availability of rich data sources capturing previously unobservable facets and also due to initiatives from government public health and funding agencies. This has resulted, in particular, in a spate of work on 'data-centered' solutions which have shown potential in enhancing our forecasting capabilities by leveraging non-traditional data sources as well as recent innovations in AI and machine learning. This survey delves into various data-driven methodological and practical advancements and introduces a conceptual framework to navigate through them. First, we enumerate the large number of epidemiological datasets and novel data streams that are relevant to epidemic forecasting, capturing various factors like symptomatic online surveys, retail and commerce, mobility, genomics data and more. Next, we discuss methods and modeling paradigms focusing on the recent data-driven statistical and deep-learning based methods as well as on the novel class of hybrid models that combine domain knowledge of mechanistic models with the effectiveness and flexibility of statistical approaches. We also discuss experiences and challenges that arise in real-world deployment of these forecasting systems including decision-making informed by forecasts. Finally, we highlight some challenges and open problems found across the forecasting pipeline.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard tool to image the human brain in vivo . In this domain, digital brain atlases are essential for subject-specific segmentation of anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and spatial comparison of neuroanatomy from different subjects in a common coordinate frame. High-resolution, digital atlases derived from histology (e.g., Allen atlas [7], BigBrain [13], Julich [15]), are currently the state of the art and provide exquisite 3D cytoarchitectural maps, but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Here we present NextBrain , a next - generation probabilistic atlas of human brain anatomy built from serial 3D histology and corresponding highly granular delineations of five whole brain hemispheres. We developed AI techniques to align and reconstruct ∼10,000 histological sections into coherent 3D volumes with joint geometric constraints (no overlap or gaps between sections), as well as to semi-automatically trace the boundaries of 333 distinct anatomical ROIs on all these sections. Comprehensive delineation on multiple cases enabled us to build the first probabilistic histological atlas of the whole human brain . Further, we created a companion Bayesian tool for automated segmentation of the 333 ROIs in any in vivo or ex vivo brain MRI scan using the NextBrain atlas. We showcase two applications of the atlas: automated segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of Alzheimer’s disease and healthy brain ageing based on ∼4,000 publicly available in vivo MRI scans. We publicly release: the raw and aligned data (including an online visualisation tool); the probabilistic atlas; the segmentation tool; and ground truth delineations for a 100 μm isotropic ex vivo hemisphere (that we use for quantitative evaluation of our segmentation method in this paper). By enabling researchers worldwide to analyse brain MRI scans at a superior level of granularity without manual effort or highly specific neuroanatomical knowledge, NextBrain holds promise to increase the specificity of MRI findings and ultimately accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Robust cancer prognostication can enable more effective patient care and management, which may potentially improve health outcomes. Deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool to extract meaningful information from cancer patient data. In recent years it has displayed promise in quantifying prognostication by predicting patient risk. However, most current deep learning-based cancer prognosis prediction methods use only a single data source and miss out on learning from potentially rich relationships across modalities. Existing multimodal approaches are challenging to interpret in a biological or medical context, limiting real-world clinical integration as a trustworthy prognostic decision aid. Here, we developed a multimodal modeling approach that can integrate information from the central modalities of gene expression, DNA methylation, and histopathological imaging with clinical information for cancer prognosis prediction. Our multimodal modeling approach combines pathway and gene-based sparsely coded layers with patch-based graph convolutional networks to facilitate biological interpretation of the model results. We present a preliminary analysis that compares the potential applicability of combining all modalities to uni- or bi-modal approaches. Leveraging data from four cancer subtypes from the Cancer Genome Atlas, results demonstrate the encouraging performance of our multimodal approach (C-index=0.660 without clinical features; C-index=0.665 with clinical features) across four cancer subtypes versus unimodal approaches and existing state-of-the-art approaches. This work brings insight to the development of interpretable multimodal methods of applying AI to biomedical data and can potentially serve as a foundation for clinical implementations of such software. We plan to follow up this preliminary analysis with an in-depth exploration of factors to improve multimodal modeling approaches on an in-house dataset.",

      "abstract": "The biogenesis of mitochondria relies on the import of hundreds of different precursor proteins from the cytosol. Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ in respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo . With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34 apparently serves as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.",

      "abstract": "In the field of genomics, the broad availability of genetic information offered by next-generation sequencing technologies and rapid growth in biomedical publication has led to the advent of the big-data era. Integration of artificial intelligence. (AI) approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to tackle the challenges of scalability and high dimensionality of data and to transform big data into clinically actionable knowledge is expanding and becoming the foundation of precision medicine. In this paper, we review the current status and future directions of AI application in genomics within the context of workflows to integrate genomic analysis for precision cancer care. The existing solutions of AI and their limitations in cancer genetic testing and diagnostics such as variant calling and interpretation are critically analyzed. In addition, the present paper highlights the challenges to AI adoption in digital healthcare with regard to data requirements, algorithmic transparency, reproducibility, and real-world assessment, and discusses the importance of preparing patients and physicians for modern digitized healthcare. We believe that AI will remain the main driver to healthcare transformation toward precision medicine, yet the unprecedented challenges posed should be addressed to ensure safety and beneficial impact to healthcare.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Strong evidence suggests that human human RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical factors for viral infection, yet there is no feasible experimental approach to map exact binding sites of RBPs across the SARS-CoV-2 genome systematically at a large scale. We investigated the role of RBPs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 by constructing the first in silico map of human RBP / viral RNA interactions at nucleotide-resolution using two deep learning methods (pysster and DeepRiPe) trained on data from CLIP-seq experiments. We evaluated conservation of RBP binding between 6 other human pathogenic coronaviruses and identified sites of conserved and differential binding in the UTRs of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS. We scored the impact of variants from 11 viral strains on protein-RNA interaction, identifying a set of gain-and loss of binding events. Lastly, we linked RBPs to functional data and OMICs from other studies, and identified MBNL1, FTO and FXR2 as potential clinical biomarkers. Our results contribute towards a deeper understanding of how viruses hijack host cellular pathways and are available through a comprehensive online resource ( https://sc2rbpmap.helmholtz-muenchen.de ).",

We introduce Computational Sorting and Mapping of Single cells (COSMOS), a platform for phenotyping and enrichment of cells based on deep learning interpretation of high-content morphology data in realtime. By training models on an atlas of >1.5 billion images, we demonstrate enrichment of unlabeled cells up to 33,000-fold. By applying COSMOS to tissue samples we identify malignant cells with similar accuracy to molecular approaches while enriching cells for functional evaluation. We show high-dimensional embedding vectors of morphology without any need for complex sample pre-processing, gating, or bioinformatics capabilities, which enables discovery of cellular phenotypes and integration of morphology into single-cell multimodal analyses as a new “omic”.

      "abstract": "Cell segmentation is the foundation of a wide range of microscopy-based biological studies. Deep learning has revolutionized 2D cell segmentation, enabling generalized solutions across cell types and imaging modalities. This has been driven by the ease of scaling up image acquisition, annotation, and computation. However, 3D cell segmentation, requiring dense annotation of 2D slices still poses significant challenges. Manual labeling of 3D cells to train broadly applicable segmentation models is prohibitive. Even in high-contrast images annotation is ambiguous and time-consuming. Here we develop a theory and toolbox, u-Segment3D, for 2D-to-3D segmentation, compatible with any 2D method generating pixel-based instance cell masks. u-Segment3D translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data, as demonstrated on 11 real-life datasets, >70,000 cells, spanning single cells, cell aggregates, and tissue. Moreover, u-Segment3D is competitive with native 3D segmentation, even exceeding when cells are crowded and have complex morphologies.",

      "title": "Predicting Severe COVID-19 Patients Based on Deep Learning: An Application of DeepFM Model",
      "abstract": "Background: The importance of using deep learning to predict severe COVID-19 patients lies in its powerful capabilities to analyze, recognize, and predict patterns from large, complex, and high-dimensional data, such as medical images, health records, and genomics data. Deep learning algorithms can help identify high-risk patients early, efficiently allocate medical resources, and improve the treatment outcomes. By predicting the disease progress, hospitals can better prepare for the surge in demand for healthcare services and reduce the mortality rate. Additionally, understanding the disease pattern can also help develop targeted interventions and preventive strategies. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created formidable challenges for world health systems. Notably, its severity varies among patients, with some developing severe symptoms requiring critical care, while others only showing mild symptoms or remaining asymptomatic. Therefore, to manage hospital resources efficiently and improve patient outcomes, it is paramount to promptly identify the patients who are likely to develop severe symptoms using robust techniques like deep learning.<br><br>Methods: The COVID-19 data (https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referentea-casos-covid-19-en-mexico) is sourced from open data collected by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The dataset includes patient personal information, medical history, and lifestyle habits. Given the high dimensionality and sparsity of healthcare data, we implemented the DeepFM model, focusing on feature interactions. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets, where the cross-entropy loss function was employed during the training process to quantify the disparity between the predicted outcomes and the real labels. We iteratively updated the model parameters through backpropagation and optimization algorithms to enhance its performance in predicting severe COVID-19 patients. The model was regularized to prevent overfitting, employing techniques such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, or early stopping. Accuracy, precision, AUC, recall, and F1-score were used as metrics to evaluate the model’s predictive ability. To discover the optimal combination of hyperparameters, grid search methodology was employed.<br><br>Results: In the study, 20 features were included in the risk prediction model. Among all evaluation metrics, the DeepFM model performed the best, with the highest precision (0.957428), recall (0.986928), accuracy (0.957580), F1 score (0.971954), and AUC score (0.929431). The logistic regression model performed poorly in terms of precision (0.834671), accuracy (0.835188), F1 score (0.897713), and AUC score (0.704874) but excelled in recall (0.971055). The decision tree and random forest models showed similar performance. The decision tree had precision (0.841756), recall (0.948646), accuracy (0.828929), F1 score (0.892011), and AUC score (0.714105). The random forest model had precision (0.841021), recall (0.953315), accuracy (0.831015), F1 score (0.893654), and AUC score (0.713715). The XGBoost model performed well across all evaluation metrics but fell short of the DeepFM model. XGBoost had precision (0.844390), recall (0.962652), accuracy (0.840056), F1 score (0.899651), and AUC score (0.722470). In summary, the DeepFM model outperformed others in these evaluation metrics and is the optimal choice.<br><br>Conclusions: In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of deep learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare. The DeepFM model effectively separates continuous and categorical features to improve the predictive accuracy of the model. This study presents crucial findings on the capability of advanced deep learning architectures to forecast severe cases of COVID-19 using limited-scale datasets.

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that global health, social systems, and economies can be surprisingly fragile in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. Yet, during the last half of 2022, and quite remarkably, we began dismantling essential infectious disease monitoring programs in several countries. Absent such programs, localized biological risks will transform into global shocks linked directly to our lack of foresight regarding emerging health risks. Additionally, recent studies indicate that more than half of all infectious diseases could be made worse by climate change, complicating pandemic containment. Despite this complexity, the factors leading to pandemics are largely predictable but can only be realized through a well-designed global early warning system. Such a system should integrate data from genomics, climate and environment, social dynamics, and healthcare infrastructure. The glue for such a system is community-driven modeling, a modern logistics of data, and democratization of AI tools. Using the example of dengue fever in Brazil, we can demonstrate how thoughtfully designed technology platforms can build global-scale precision disease detection and response systems that significantly reduce exposure to systemic shocks, accelerate science-informed public health policies, and deliver reliable healthcare and economic opportunities as an intrinsic part of the global sustainable development agenda.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Background: The data explosion caused by unprecedented advancements in the field of genomics is constantly challenging the conventional methods used in the interpretation of the human genome. The demand for robust algorithms over the recent years has brought huge success in the field of Deep Learning (DL) in solving many difficult tasks in image, speech and natural language processing by automating the manual process of architecture design. This has been fueled through the development of new DL architectures. Yet genomics possesses unique challenges that requires customization and development of new DL models. <h4>Methods:</h4> We proposed a new model, DASSI, by adapting a differential architecture search method and applying it to the Splice Site (SS) recognition task on DNA sequences to discover new high-performance convolutional architectures in an automated manner. We evaluated the discovered model against state-of-the-art tools to classify true and false SS in Homo sapiens (Human), Arabidopsis thaliana (Plant), Caenorhabditis elegans (Worm) and Drosophila melanogaster (Fly). <h4>Results:</h4> Our experimental evaluation demonstrated that the discovered architecture outperformed baseline models and fixed architectures and showed competitive results against state-of-the-art models used in classification of splice sites. The proposed model - DASSI has a compact architecture and showed very good results on a transfer learning task. The benchmarking experiments of execution time and precision on architecture search and evaluation process showed better performance on recently available GPUs making it feasible to adopt architecture search based methods on large datasets. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> We proposed the use of differential architecture search method (DASSI) to perform SS classification on raw DNA sequences, and discovered new neural network models with low number of tunable parameters and competitive performance compared with manually engineered architectures. We have extensively benchmarked DASSI model with other state-of-the-art models and assessed its computational efficiency. The results have shown a high potential of using automated architecture search mechanism for solving various problems in the field of genomics.</p>",

      "abstract": "Understanding evolutionary variation in genomic sequences through the lens of language modeling has the potential to revolutionize biological research. Yet to maximize the utility of language modeling in genomics, we must overcome computational challenges in tokenization and model architecture adapted to diverse genomic features across evolutionary timescales. In this study, we investigated key elements in genomic language modeling (gLM), including tokenization, pretraining datasets, fine-tuning approaches, pooling methods, and domain adaptation, and applied the language models to diverse genomic data. We gathered two evolutionarily distinct pretraining datasets: one consisting of 19,551 reference genomes, including over 18,000 prokaryotic genomes (115B nucleotides) and the remainder eukaryotic genomes, and another more balanced dataset with 1,354 genomes, including 1,166 prokaryotic and 188 eukaryotic reference genomes (180B nucleotides). We trained five byte-pair encoding tokenizers and pretrained 52 gLMs, systematically comparing different architectures, hyperparameters, and classification heads. We introduce  seqLens , a family of models based on disentangled attention with relative positional encoding, which outperforms relatively similar-sized models in 13 of 19 benchmarking phenotypic predictions. We further explore continual pretraining, domain adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to assess trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that relevant pretraining data significantly boost performance, alternative pooling techniques can enhance classification, tokenizers with larger vocabulary sizes negatively impact generalization, and gLMs are capable of understanding evolutionary relationships.

      "abstract": "Morphological information from histopathology slides and molecular profiles from genomic data are important for predicting the staging of lung cancer. However, most deep learning-based prediction results are based on histopathology or genomics alone, which do not fully utilize the complementary information of both and ignore staining differences in histopathology images due to different staining conditions. In this study, we propose a Multimodal Multi-scale Attention Model (MMAM) to predict patients’ lung cancer staging outcomes by end-to-end multimodal fusion of patients' multi-scale histopathology image features with genetic features by augmented attention. The proposed MMAM consists of two phases. In the first phase, a Staining Difference Elimination Network (SDEN) is proposed for stable detection of histopathology image features to eliminate differences arising from different hospital/specimen staining conditions. In the second phase, we design a Multimodal Multi-scale Fusion Network (MMFN) to efficiently fuse different modality features. We have validated our approach on the lung cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The results show that the proposed MMAM improves the staging effectiveness of the fusion network of histopathological and genomic features, reduces the effect of appearance variability due to staining differences on blurred pictures, achieves an AUC of 88.51%, and outperforms other popular methods in predicting lung cancer staging.",

      "abstract": "The development of deep learning (DL) models to predict the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) from histopathology images (imCMS) is a promising and cost-effective strategy to support patient stratification. Here, we investigate whether imCMS calls generated from whole slide histopathology images (WSIs) of rectal cancer (RC) pre-treatment biopsies are associated with pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant long course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) with single agent fluoropyrimidine. DL models were trained to classify WSIs of colorectal cancers stained with hematoxylin and eosin into one of the four CMS classes using a multi-centric dataset of resection and biopsy specimens (n=1057 WSIs) with paired transcriptional data. Classifiers were tested on a held out RC biopsy cohort (ARISTOTLE) and correlated with pCR to LCRT in an independent dataset merging two RC cohorts (ARISTOTLE, n=114 and SALZBURG, n=55 patients). DL models predicted CMS with high classification performance in multiple comparative analyses. In the independent cohorts (ARISTOTLE, SALZBURG), cases with WSIs classified as imCMS1 had a significantly higher likelihood of achieving pCR (OR=2.69, 95%CI 1.01-7.17, p=0.048). Conversely, imCMS4 was associated with lack of pCR (OR=0.25, 95%CI 0.07-0.88, p=0.031). Classification maps demonstrated pathologist-interpretable associations with high stromal content in imCMS4 cases, associated with poor outcome. No significant association was found in imCMS2 or imCMS3. imCMS classification of pre-treatment biopsies is a fast and inexpensive solution to identify patient groups that could benefit from neoadjuvant LCRT. The significant associations between imCMS1/imCMS4 with pCR suggest the existence of predictive morphological features that could enhance standard pathological assessment.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning has made several inroads into the study of brain-behavior relations based on in vivo imaging. While the advent of deep neural networks was expected to further improve predictions, the current literature based on resting-state functional connectivity presents mixed results. We hypothesize that the representation of the data, i.e. in the form of functional connectivity, could restrict an advantage of deep learning techniques, namely that of learning complex representations directly from the data. Thus, we investigated if bypassing this feature extraction resulted in improved performance in the prediction of 58 widely studied behavioral traits from a large sample of Human Connectome Project subjects, using deep learning techniques. For this task, we adapted the InceptionTime architecture, which jointly predicts traits directly from regional time series through representation learning, and compared results with a strong kernel-based baseline. Results revealed that both models achieve comparable performance in most traits. Eleven significant differences in mean squared error were detected, however, with seven favoring the neural network approach, and this number increased when accounting for covariates. We additionally show that contrary to the expectation, the neural network approach was more robust to reductions in the training set size. On the other hand, it was more sensitive to reductions in the length of the time series at test time. Our results present a more nuanced view of the potential of deep learning for the prediction of behavior from neuroimaging, which allows learning features directly from the data.",

      "abstract": "Despite the pervasiveness of ordinal labels in supervised learning, it remains common practice in deep learning to treat such problems as categorical classification using the categorical cross entropy loss. Recent methods attempting to address this issue while respecting the ordinal structure of the labels have resorted to converting ordinal regression into a series of extended binary classification subtasks. However, the adoption of such methods remains inconsistent due to theoretical and practical limitations. Here we address these limitations by demonstrating that the subtask probabilities form a Markov chain. We show how to straightforwardly modify neural network architectures to exploit this fact and thereby constrain predictions to be universally rank consistent. We furthermore prove that all rank consistent solutions can be represented within this formulation, and derive a loss function producing maximum likelihood parameter estimates. Using diverse benchmarks and the real-world application of a specialized recurrent neural network for COVID-19 prognosis, we demonstrate the practical superiority of this method versus the current state-of-the-art.

      "title": "Do Domain-Specific Protein Language Models Outperform General Models on Immunology-Related Tasks?",
      "abstract": "Deciphering the antigen recognition capabilities by T cell and B cell receptors (antibodies) is essential for advancing our understanding of adaptive immune system responses. In recent years, the development of protein language models (PLMs) has facilitated the development of bioinformatic pipelines where complex amino acid sequences are transformed into vectorized embeddings, which are then applied to a range of downstream analytical tasks. With their success, we have witnessed the emergence of domain-specific PLMs tailored to specific proteins, such as immune receptors. Domain-specific models are often assumed to possess enhanced representation capabilities for targeted applications, however, this assumption has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this manuscript, we assess the efficacy of both generalist and domain-specific transformer-based embeddings in characterizing B and T cell receptors. Specifically, we assess the accuracy of models that leverage these embeddings to predict antigen specificity and elucidate the evolutionary changes that B cells undergo during an immune response. We demonstrate that the prevailing notion of domain-specific models outperforming general models requires a more nuanced examination. We also observe remarkable differences between generalist and domain-specific PLMs, not only in terms of performance but also in the manner they encode information. Finally, we observe that the choice of the size and the embedding layer in PLMs are essential model hyperparameters in different tasks. Overall, our analyzes reveal the promising potential of PLMs in modeling protein function while providing insights into their information-handling capabilities. We also discuss the crucial factors that should be taken into account when selecting a PLM tailored to a particular task.",

      "title": "Metagenomics reveals cryptic circulation of zoonotic viruses in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Zoonotic spillover events pose an ongoing threat to global health, with historic and recent viral diseases of international concern emerging from animal reservoirs 1–6. In Nigeria, limited surveillance of animal hosts at the human and animal interface continues to hinder our understanding of viruses that are cryptically circulating in animals near human dwellings with potential for consequential spillover events. We performed unbiased metagenomic next‑generation sequencing (mNGS) on tissue and swab samples collected from 240 individual animals across 11 taxa (rodents, shrews, bats, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens, cattle egrets, and lizards) in two Lassa‑affected Nigerian states (Ondo and Ebonyi). Host‑depleted sequencing reads were assembled into contigs, taxonomically classified, and subjected to phylogenetic analyses to characterize viral diversity, host associations, and evidence of cross‑species transmission. Across all samples, we identified 214 distinct viral taxa spanning 33 families, of which 41% (n = 83) represent novel species by ICTV criteria. Positive‑sense RNA viruses dominated (Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae), followed by negative‑sense RNA, single‑ and double‑stranded DNA, and double‑stranded RNA viruses. Notably, human‑associated enteroviruses—including Hepatitis A virus (genotype 1b), echoviruses, coxsackieviruses, and noroviruses—were detected in goats, pigs, dogs, and chickens, indicating cryptic circulation of human pathogens in peridomestic and domesticated animals. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed multiple cross‑species viral sharing events, particularly among rodents, goats, sheep, and pigs, and extensive recombination within Nigerian Betacoronavirus 1 lineages. Interestingly we found a putative novel avian like coronavirus in rodents, goats and sheep. Ecological modelling demonstrated that host species identity, sample type, and sampling effort were primary drivers of viral richness and abundance, and that higher overall viral diversity strongly predicted cross‑species transmission potential. Our integrated mNGS approach uncovered a rich and dynamic virome within animals inhabiting human‑dominated environments in Nigeria, including undetected circulation of human enteric viruses. These findings underscore the importance of broad‑taxonomic, real‑time surveillance at human–animal interfaces to inform early‑warning systems and pandemic preparedness, particularly in low‑resource settings.</p>",

      "title": "BindingSiteAugmentedDTA: Enabling A Next-Generation Pipeline for Interpretable Prediction Models in Drug-Repurposing",
      "abstract": "While research into Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) prediction is fairly mature, generalizability and interpretability are not always addressed in the existing works in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework, called BindingSite-AugmentedDTA, which improves Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) predictions by reducing the search space of potential binding sites of the protein, thus making the binding affinity prediction more efficient and accurate. Our BindingSite-AugmentedDTA is highly generalizable as it can be integrated with any DL-based regression model, while it significantly improves their prediction performance. Also, unlike many existing models, our model is highly interpretable due to its architecture and self-attention mechanism, which can provide a deeper understanding of its underlying prediction mechanism by mapping attention weights back to protein binding sites. The computational results confirm that our framework can enhance the prediction performance of seven state-of-the-art DTA prediction algorithms in terms of 4 widely used evaluation metrics, including Concordance Index (CI), Mean Squared Error (MSE), modified squared correlation coefficient , and the Area Under the Precision Curve (AUPC). We also contribute to the two most commonly used DTA benchmark datasets, namely Kiba and Davis, by including additional information on 3D structure of all proteins contained in these two datasets. We manually extracted this information from Protein Data Bank (PDB) files of proteins available at https://www.uniprot.org/ . Furthermore, we experimentally validate the practical potential of our proposed framework through in-lab experiments. We measure the binding interaction between several drug candidate compounds for the inhibition of binding between (SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD) Spike and ACE-2 (host cell binding target) proteins. We then compare the computationally-predicted results against the ones experimentally-observed in the laboratory. The relatively high agreement between computationally-predicted and experimentally-observed binding interactions supports the potential of our framework as the next-generation pipeline for prediction models in drug repurposing.",

      "abstract": "Unbiased characterization of whole-brain cytoarchitecture represents an invaluable tool for understanding brain function. For this, precise mapping of histological markers from 2D sections onto 3D brain atlases is pivotal. Here, we present two novel software tools facilitating this process: Aligning Big Brains and Atlases (ABBA), designed to streamline the precise and efficient registration of 2D sections to 3D reference atlases, and BraiAn, an integrated suite for multi-marker automated segmentation, whole-brain statistical analysis, and data visualisation. Combining these tools, we performed a comprehensive comparative study of the whole-brain expression of three of the most widely used immediate early genes (IEGs). Thanks to their neural activity-dependent expression, IEGs have been used for decades as a proxy of neural activity to generate unbiased mapping of activity following behaviour, but their respective induction in response to neuronal activation across the entire brain remains unclear. To address this question, we systematically compared the brain-wide expression cFos, Arc and NPAS4, three abundantly used IEGs, across three different behavioural conditions related to memory. Our results highlight major differences in both their distribution and induction patterns, indicating that they do not represent equivalent markers across brain areas or activity states, but can provide instead complementary information.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Food-grade titanium dioxide (fgTiO 2 ) is a bio-persistent particle under intense regulatory scrutiny. Paradoxically, meaningful in vivo cellular accumulation has never been demonstrated: the only known cell reservoirs for fgTiO 2 are ‘graveyard’ intestinal pigment cells which are metabolically and immunologically quiescent. Here we identify major new immunocompetent cell targets of fgTiO 2 in humans, most notably in the subepithelial dome region of intestinal Peyer’s patches. Using multimodal microscopy techniques with single-particle detection and per-cell / vesicle image analysis we achieved correlative dosimetry, quantitatively recapitulating human cellular exposures in the terminal ileum of mice fed a fgTiO 2 -containing diet. Epithelial microfold cells selectively funneled fgTiO 2 into LysoMac and LysoDC cells with ensuing accumulation. Notwithstanding, proximity extension analyses for 92 protein targets revealed no measureable perturbation of cell signalling pathways. When chased with oral Δ aroA - Salmonella , pro-inflammatory signalling was confirmed, but no augmentation by fgTiO 2 was revealed despite marked same-cell loading. Interestingly, Salmonella caused the fgTiO 2 -recipient cells to migrate basolaterally in the patch and, sporadically, to the lamina propria, thereby fully recreating the intestinal tissue distribution of fgTiO 2 in humans. Immunocompetent cells that accumulate fgTiO 2 in vivo are now identified and we demonstrate a mouse model that finally enables human-relevant risk assessments of ingested, bio-persistent (nano)particles.",

      "abstract": "Training in behavioral tasks can alter visual cortical stimulus coding, but the precise form of this plasticity is unclear. We measured orientation tuning in 4,000-neuron populations of mouse V1 before and after training on a visuomotor task. Changes to single-cell tuning curves were apparently complex, including appearance of asymmetric and multi-peaked tuning curves. Nevertheless, these changes reflected a simple mathematical transformation of population activity, suppressing responses to motor-associated stimuli specifically in cells responding at intermediate levels. The strength of the transformation varied across trials, suggesting a dynamic circuit mechanism rather than static synaptic plasticity. This transformation resulted in sparsening and orthogonalization of population codes for motor-associated stimuli. Training did not improve the performance of an optimal stimulus decoder, which was already perfect even for naïve codes, but the resulting orthogonalization improved the performance of a suboptimal decoder model with inductive bias as might be found in downstream readout circuits.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Objectives</h4> To aid research on etiology and treatment of the heterogeneous rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, we aimed to identify phenotypically distinct RA subsets using baseline clinical data. <h4>Method</h4> We collected hematology, serology, joint location, age and sex of RA-patients from the Leiden Rheumatology clinic(n=1,387). We used deep learning and clustering to identify phenotypically distinct RA subsets. To ensure robustness, we tested a) cluster stability, b) physician impact, c) association with remission and methotrexate failure, d) replication in clinical trial data (n=307) and independent secondary care (9 clinics, n=515). <h4>Results</h4> We identified four subsets: Cluster-1) arthritis in feet, Cluster-2) seropositive oligo-articular disease, Cluster-3) seronegative hand arthritis, and Cluster-4) polyarthritis. We found high cluster stability, no physician influence, significant difference in methotrexate failure( P <0.001) and occurrence of remission (P =0.007). The MTX-failure rates were recurrent in both replication sets(both P <0.001). The hand-Cluster-3 showed best outcomes, especially compared to Cluster-4 ( P <0.001) and Cluster-1 ( P =0.003). The MTX-failure difference was largest in the ACPA-positive stratum (Cluster-3 versus Cluster-1 (HR:0.3 (0.15-0.60) P <0.001), Cluster-3 versus Cluster-4 HR:0.33 (0.15-0.72) P =0.005). We observed this for Cluster-4 in all sets, and for Cluster-1 in two out of three. This was independent of baseline disease activity and symptom duration. The clusters significantly improved the MTX failure model on top of traditional risk factors. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We discovered and replicated four phenotypic subgroups of RA at baseline characterized by hand and foot involvement that associate with treatment response. Such knowledge on disease subgroups could enhance studies to the treatment and the mechanisms underlying RA. <h4>KEY MESSAGES</h4> What is already known about the subject? - Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous disease and clinicians have not completely identified the disease differentiating patterns in clinical practice. - Data-driven unsupervised techniques are able to identify hidden structures in big data. What does this study add? - We identified four RA clusters at baseline: feet involvement, oligo-articular disease, hand involvement and polyarthritis (both feet and hand involvement). The hand cluster shows a good treatment response, especially when compared to the polyarthritis and feet group. - The difference in treatment success between hands vs foot clusters was largest in the ACPA-positive stratum. How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments? . - This research supports future endeavors in identifying etiological mechanisms and tailored treatment solutions. - Feet involvement at disease presentation can be considered a risk factor for less successful treatment. - Depending on the location of inflamed joints at first presentation, RA-patients might need different treatment.",

By utilizing the proposed RFCN architectures, automatic hyper-parameter search and neural architecture search algorithms, AutoGenome can train high-performance deep learning models for various kinds of genomic profiling data automatically. To make researchers better understand the trained models, AutoGenome can assess the feature importance and export the most important features for supervised learning tasks, and the representative latent vectors for unsupervised learning tasks.

Among differentially enriched proteins we find kinases, putative microtubule-interacting proteins, polar SOSEKIs with their effector ANGUSTIFOLIA, and using AI-facilitated protein structure prediction models, we identify their potential interaction interfaces. Functional and localization analysis of polarity protein OPL2 and its newly discovered partners suggest a positive interaction with mitotic microtubules and a potential role in cytokinesis.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is marked by progressive cognitive decline, yet the mechanisms underlying impaired memory encoding are not fully understood. To address this, we investigated hippocampal activity in 5xFAD mice performing a continuous spatial alternation task, combining head-fixed behavioural assessment with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. 5xFAD mice exhibited deficits in alternation performance and task acquisition, which progressively worsened with age and were accompanied by behavioural hyperactivity and impaired speed modulation. Importantly, hippocampal CA1 neurons in 5xFAD mice showed impairments in spatial representation. Compared to non-5xFAD sibling controls, 5xFAD mice exhibited a lower proportion of place cells, reduced spatial information, and diminished trial-to-trial reliability. Moreover, reward location encoding was disrupted during goal-directed navigation. Despite these deficits, stable place cells retained relatively consistent spatial tuning across learning sessions. Finally, hippocampal trajectory-dependent activity (splitter cells) was significantly impaired in 5xFAD mice, with age-related declines in discriminability, reliability, and splitter extent. These impairments correlated with task performance and were more pronounced than behavioural deficits, suggesting that disrupted contextual encoding may precede and predict cognitive decline in AD. Together, our findings reveal early and progressive impairments in hippocampal spatial and contextual representations in 5xFAD mice, which contribute to behavioural deficits and provide insights into AD pathophysiology. <h4>Teaser</h4> Two-photon hippocampal imaging in behaving AD mice reveals impairments in spatial and contextual memory circuits contribute to cognitive deficits.",

These applications and one approved application were assessed as on the market without the required regulatory approvals. According to our analysis, a higher proportion of these apps would be classified as medical devices in the US. The level of risk posed by gamification remains ambiguous. While most apps showed only a weak link between the degree of gamification and potential risks, this link was stronger for those apps with a high degree of gamification or an immersive serious game experience.</p>",

      "abstract": "The tremendous success of graphical neural networks (GNNs) has already had a major impact on systems biology research. For example, GNNs are currently used for drug target recognition in protein-drug interaction networks as well as cancer gene discovery and more. Important aspects whose practical relevance is often underestimated are comprehensibility, interpretability, and explainability. In this work, we present a graph-based deep learning framework for disease subnetwork detection via explainable GNNs. In our framework, each patient is represented by the topology of a protein-protein network (PPI), and the nodes are enriched by molecular multimodal data, such as gene expression and DNA methylation. Therefore, our novel modification of the GNNexplainer for model-wide explanations can detect potential disease subnetworks, which is of high practical relevance. The proposed methods are implemented in the GNN-SubNet Python program, which we have made freely available on our GitHub for the international research community ( https://github.com/pievos101/GNN-SubNet ).",

      "title": "Patient-Related Metadata Reported in Sequencing Studies of SARS-CoV-2: Protocol for a Scoping Review and Bibliometric Analysis",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> There has been an unprecedented effort to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 virus and examine its molecular evolution. This has been facilitated by the availability of publicly accessible databases, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and GenBank, which collectively hold millions of SARS-CoV-2 sequence records. Genomic epidemiology, however, seeks to go beyond phylogenetic analysis by linking genetic information to patient characteristics and disease outcomes, enabling a comprehensive understanding of transmission dynamics and disease impact. While these repositories include fields reflecting patient-related metadata for a given sequence, inclusion of these demographic and clinical details is scarce. The extent to which patient-related metadata is reported in published sequencing studies and its quality remains largely unexplored. <h4>Methods</h4> The NIH’s LitCovid collection will be used for automated classification of articles reporting having deposited SARS-CoV-2 sequences in public repositories, while an independent search will be conducted in PubMed for validation. Data extraction will be conducted using Covidence. The extracted data will be synthesized and summarized to quantify the availability of patient metadata in the published literature of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies. For the bibliometric analysis, relevant data points, such as author affiliations and citation metrics will be extracted. <h4>Discussion</h4> This scoping review will report on the extent and types of patient-related metadata reported in genomic viral sequencing studies of SARS-CoV-2, identify gaps in this reporting, and make recommendations for improving the quality and consistency of reporting in this area. The bibliometric analysis will uncover trends and patterns in the reporting of patient-related metadata, including differences in reporting based on study types or geographic regions. Co-occurrence networks of author keywords will also be presented. The insights gained from this study may help improve the quality and consistency of reporting patient metadata, enhancing the utility of sequence metadata and facilitating future research on infectious diseases. <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4> Classification of papers using machine learning will help pinpoint more relevant papers reducing time to sift through articles for inclusion. Study will provide an overview of the availability of information required to facilitate genomic epidemiology studies of SARS-CoV-2 The bibliometric analysis will analyze publication trends, author affiliations, citation metrics, and other bibliographic information to provide several insights into the broader landscape of research that includes patient metadata reporting in genomic viral sequencing studies of SARS-CoV-2 As with any search method for relevant studies, some may be missed by both the automated methods proposed and manually developed queries.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental challenge to the production of climate-resilient crops is how to measure dynamic yield-relevant responses to the environment, such as growth rate, at a scale which informs mechanistic understanding and accelerates breeding. The timing, duration and architectural characteristics of inflorescence growth are crucial for optimising crop productivity and have been targets of selection during domestication. We report a robust and versatile procedure for computationally assessing environmentally-responsive flowering dynamics. In the oilseed crop, Brassica napus, there is wide variation in flowering response to winter cold (vernalization). We subjected a diverse set of B. napus accessions to different vernalization temperatures and monitored shoot responses using automated image acquisition. We developed methods to computationally infer multiple aspects of flowering from this dynamic data, enabling characterisation of speed, duration and peaks of inflorescence development across different crop types. We input these multiple traits to genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies, and identified potentially causative variation in a priori phenology genes (including EARLY FLOWERING3) for known traits and in uncharacterised genes for computed traits. These results could be used in marker assisted breeding to design new ideotypes for improved yield and better adaptation to changing climatic conditions.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) has claimed millions of lives and has affected all aspects of human life. This paper focuses on the application of deep learning (DL) models to medical imaging and drug discovery for managing COVID-19 disease. In this article, we detail various medical imaging-based studies such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images along with DL methods for classifying COVID-19 affected versus pneumonia. The applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL techniques in drug or vaccine discovery in combating the coronavirus. Finally, we address a number of problems, concerns and future research directions relevant to DL applications for COVID-19.",

While the neural mechanisms underlying first-order conditioning (FOC) are well characterized, the circuits supporting SOC expression remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated the brain regions and cell types involved in SOC recall in mice and tackled the technical challenges of quantifying brain-wide neural activity. We employed a light–tone SOC paradigm in TRAP2:Ai14 mice, which allowed us to tag neurons active during SOC recall via tdTomato expression. Applying generalized linear models, we identified that the activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 regions of the dorsal hippocampus significantly associated with SOC-related behavioral responses. To test their functional relevance, we used chemogenetic inhibition of CaMKII + neurons in these regions, which confirmed a causal role for DG/CA3 circuits in SOC recall. Together, our results highlight the dorsal hippocampus as a critical substrate for retrieving indirectly learned associations.",

      "title": "GestaltMatcher Database - A global reference for facial phenotypic variability in rare human diseases",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>The most important factor that complicates the work of dysmorphologists is the significant phenotypic variability of the human face. Next-Generation Phenotyping (NGP) tools that assist clinicians with recognizing characteristic syndromic patterns are particularly challenged when confronted with patients from populations different from their training data. To that end, we systematically analyzed the impact of genetic ancestry on facial dysmorphism. For that purpose, we established the GestaltMatcher Database (GMDB) as a reference dataset for medical images of patients with rare genetic disorders from around the world. We collected 10,980 frontal facial images – more than a quarter previously unpublished - from 8,346 patients, representing 581 rare disorders. Although the predominant ancestry is still European (67%), data from underrepresented populations have been increased considerably via global collaborations (19% Asian and 7% African). This includes previously unpublished reports for more than 40% of the African patients. The NGP analysis on this diverse dataset revealed characteristic performance differences depending on the composition of training and test sets corresponding to genetic relatedness. For clinical use of NGP, incorporating non-European patients resulted in a profound enhancement of GestaltMatcher performance. The top-5 accuracy rate increased by +11.29%. Importantly, this improvement in delineating the correct disorder from a facial portrait was achieved without decreasing the performance on European patients. By design, GMDB complies with the FAIR principles by rendering the curated medical data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. This means GMDB can also serve as data for training and benchmarking. In summary, our study on facial dysmorphism on a global sample revealed a considerable cross ancestral phenotypic variability confounding NGP that should be counteracted by international efforts for increasing data diversity. GMDB will serve as a vital reference database for clinicians and a transparent training set for advancing NGP technology.</p>",

      "title": "Analysis-ready VCF at Biobank scale using Zarr",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Variant Call Format (VCF) is the standard file format for interchanging genetic variation data and associated quality control metrics. The usual row-wise encoding of the VCF data model (either as text or packed binary) emphasises efficient retrieval of all data for a given variant, but accessing data on a field or sample basis is inefficient. Biobank scale datasets currently available consist of hundreds of thousands of whole genomes and hundreds of terabytes of compressed VCF. Row-wise data storage is fundamentally unsuitable and a more scalable approach is needed. <h4>Results</h4> Zarr is a format for storing multi-dimensional data that is widely used across the sciences, and is ideally suited to massively parallel processing. We present the VCF Zarr specification, an encoding of the VCF data model using Zarr, along with fundamental software infrastructure for efficient and reliable conversion at scale. We show how this format is far more efficient than standard VCF based approaches, and competitive with specialised methods for storing genotype data in terms of compression ratios and single-threaded calculation performance. We present case studies on subsets of three large human datasets (Genomics England: n =78,195; Our Future Health: n =651,050; All of Us: n =245,394) along with whole genome datasets for Norway Spruce ( n =1,063) and SARS-CoV-2 ( n =4,484,157). We demonstrate the potential for VCF Zarr to enable a new generation of high-performance and cost-effective applications via illustrative examples using cloud computing and GPUs. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Large row-encoded VCF files are a major bottleneck for current research, and storing and processing these files incurs a substantial cost. The VCF Zarr specification, building on widely-used, open-source technologies has the potential to greatly reduce these costs, and may enable a diverse ecosystem of next-generation tools for analysing genetic variation data directly from cloud-based object stores, while maintaining compatibility with existing file-oriented workflows. <h4>Key Points</h4> VCF is widely supported, and the underlying data model entrenched in bioinformatics pipelines. The standard row-wise encoding as text (or binary) is inherently inefficient for large-scale data processing. The Zarr format provides an efficient solution, by encoding fields in the VCF separately in chunk-compressed binary format.",

      "abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of over 350,000 people and infected more than 6 million people worldwide. Several search engines have surfaced to provide researchers with additional tools to find and retrieve information from the rapidly growing corpora on COVID-19. These engines lack extraction and visualization tools necessary to retrieve and interpret complex relations inherent to scientific literature. Moreover, because these engines mainly rely upon semantic information, their ability to capture complex global relationships across documents is limited, which reduces the quality of similarity-based article recommendations for users. In this work, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph (CKG), a heterogeneous graph for extracting and visualizing complex relationships between COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG combines semantic information with document topological information for the application of similar document retrieval. The CKG is constructed using the latent schema of the data, and then enriched with biomedical entity information extracted from the unstructured text of articles using scalable AWS technologies to form relations in the graph. Finally, we propose a document similarity engine that leverages low-dimensional graph embeddings from the CKG with semantic embeddings for similar article retrieval. Analysis demonstrates the quality of relationships in the CKG and shows that it can be used to uncover meaningful information in COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG helps power www.cord19.aws and is publicly available.",

Our findings confirm the types of research available in PubMed and ArXiv differ significantly, with the former exhibiting greater diversity in terms of COVID-19 related issues and the latter focusing more on intelligent systems/tools to predict/diagnose COVID-19.

Researchers rate COVID-19 patients on a scale from 1 to 8 according to the severity level of COVID-19, 1 being healthy and 8 being extremely sick, based on a multitude of factors including number of clinic visits, days since the first sign of symptoms, and more. However, there are two issues with the current state of severity level designation. Firstly, there exists variation among researchers in determining these patient scores, which may lead to improper treatment. Secondly, researchers use a variety of metrics to determine patient severity level, including metrics involving plasma collection that require invasive procedures. This project aims to remedy both issues by introducing a machine learning framework that unifies severity level designations based on noninvasive saliva biomarkers. Our results show that we can successfully use machine learning on salivaomics data to predict the severity level of COVID-19 patients, indicating the presence of viral load using saliva biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "Hearing is an essential sense in the life cycle of malaria mosquitoes. Within large swarms formed transiently at dusk, mosquitoes acoustically recognize their mating partners by their wingbeats. Indeed, malaria mosquitoes only respond to the flight tones of mating partners during swarm time. This phenomenon implies a sophisticated context- and time-dependent modulation of mosquito audition, the mechanisms of which are still largely unknown. Using transcriptomics, we identify a complex network of candidate neuromodulators regulating mosquito hearing. Among them, octopamine stands out as regulator of the auditory performance during swarm time. To explore octopamine roles in mosquito hearing, we carried out an in-depth analysis of octopamine-mediated effects on auditory function. We found that octopamine affects the properties of the mosquito ear on multiple levels: it modulates the tuning and stiffness of the flagellar sound receiver and it controls the erection of antennal fibrillae in males. We found that two different receptors are driving octopamine auditory roles, including a novel beta octopamine receptor. We also demonstrate that the octopaminergic auditory control system can be targeted by insecticides. Our findings identify octopamine signalling as a key component of hearing and mating partner detection in malaria mosquitoes, and as a potential novel target for mosquito control.",

Such semi-quantitative scoring system, namely Brixia~score, is applied in serial monitoring of such patients, showing significant prognostic value, in one of the hospitals that experienced one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. To solve such a challenging visual task, we adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy structured to handle different tasks (segmentation, spatial alignment, and score estimation) trained with a \"from-the-part-to-the-whole\" procedure involving different datasets. In particular, we exploit a clinical dataset of almost 5,000 CXR annotated images collected in the same hospital. Our BS-Net demonstrates self-attentive behavior and a high degree of accuracy in all processing stages. Through inter-rater agreement tests and a gold standard comparison, we show that our solution outperforms single human annotators in rating accuracy and consistency, thus supporting the possibility of using this tool in contexts of computer-assisted monitoring. Highly resolved (super-pixel level) explainability maps are also generated, with an original technique, to visually help the understanding of the network activity on the lung areas. We also consider other scores proposed in literature and provide a comparison with a recently proposed non-specific approach. We eventually test the performance robustness of our model on an assorted public COVID-19 dataset, for which we also provide Brixia~score annotations, observing good direct generalization and fine-tuning capabilities that highlight the portability of BS-Net in other clinical settings. The CXR dataset along with the source code and the trained model are publicly released for research purposes.",

      "abstract": "The age of precision medicine demands powerful computational techniques to handle high-dimensional patient data. We present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep learning method for long-term pan-cancer survival prediction. MultiSurv is composed of three main modules. A feature representation module includes a dedicated submodel for each input data modality. A data fusion layer aggregates the multimodal representations. Finally, a prediction submodel yields conditional survival probabilities for a predefined set of follow-up time intervals. We trained MultiSurv on clinical, imaging, and four different high-dimensional omics data modalities from patients diagnosed with one of 33 different cancer types. We evaluated unimodal input configurations against several previous methods and different multimodal data combinations. MultiSurv achieved the best results according to different time-dependent metrics and delivered highly accurate long-term patient survival curves. The best performance was obtained when combining clinical information with either gene expression or DNA methylation data, depending on the evaluation metric. Additionally, MultiSurv can handle missing data, including missing values and complete data modalitites. Interestingly, for unimodal data we found that simpler modeling approaches, including the classical Cox proportional hazards method, can achieve results rivaling those of more complex methods for certain data modalities. We also show how the learned feature representations of MultiSurv can be used to visualize relationships between cancer types and individual patients, after embedding into a low-dimensional space.",

      "title": "DeepSide: A Deep Learning Framework for Drug Side Effect Prediction",
      "abstract": "Drug failures due to unforeseen adverse effects at clinical trials pose health risks for the participants and lead to substantial financial losses. Side effect prediction algorithms have the potential to guide the drug design process. LINCS L1000 dataset provides a vast resource of cell line gene expression data perturbed by different drugs and creates a knowledge base for context specific features. The state-of-the-art approach that aims at using context specific information relies on only the high-quality experiments in LINCS L1000 and discards a large portion of the experiments. In this study, our goal is to boost the prediction performance by utilizing this data to its full extent. We experiment with 5 deep learning architectures. We find that a multi-modal architecture produces the best predictive performance among multi-layer perceptron-based architectures when drug chemical structure (CS), and the full set of drug perturbed gene expression profiles (GEX) are used as modalities. Overall, we observe that the CS is more informative than the GEX. A convolutional neural network-based model that uses only SMILES string representation of the drugs achieves the best results and provides 13.0% macro-AUC and 3.1% micro-AUC improvements over the state-of-the-art. We also show that the model is able to predict side effect-drug pairs that are reported in the literature but was missing in the ground truth side effect dataset.

With the rapid generation of massive high-quality imaging datasets, downstream analysis is becoming the major technical bottleneck for mesoscale connectomics. Current computational solutions are labour-intensive with limited applications because of the exhaustive manual annotation and heavily customised training. Meanwhile, whole-brain data analysis always requires combining multiple packages and secondary development by users. To address these challenges, we developed D-LMBmap, an end-to-end package providing an integrated workflow containing three modules based on novel deep-learning algorithms for whole-brain connectivity mapping: axon segmentation, brain region segmentation and whole-brain registration. D-LMBmap is the first method that does not require manual annotation for axon segmentation, and achieves quantitative analysis of whole-brain projectome in a single workflow with superior accuracy for multiple cell types in all of the modalities tested.</p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Background: African health care Systems are confronted by continuing infrastructure disparities or lack of capacity about the workforce and unequal access to care. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) and data governance frameworks have become the change makers in the health sector, especially in the wake of the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (2014) which was used to provide the foundation upon which digital innovators look to bring solutions to life in the healthcare sector. <h4>Purpose:</h4> This study investigates the integration of AI in African healthcare systems post-2014. It examines the role of AI in disease detection, patient management and other health outcome, ethical standards and policy development implications. <h4>Methods:</h4> A total of 41 peer-reviewed articles published in the years between 2015 and 2023 were analysed by means of a systematic review of the literature. PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar were used as the sources. Search terms included “AI in healthcare,” “data governance” and “Africa,”. Also, the review has included the grey literature which did not follow the PRISMA guidelines. Empirical evidence of implementation of AI across African countries in the healthcare contexts was the basis of the studies selected. <h4>Results:</h4> The number of publications related to healthcare via AI has increased by 35% in 2022-2023 colocation with increasing interest and investment in this issue. It was found out that AI: contributes to significant parts of diagnostic accuracy, operational efficiency and predictive analytics in several medical disciplines. Despite these critical challenges, there remain two major sticking points regarding infrastructure, regulatory enforcement, and usage of patient data in the ethical way. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> The study indicates the need for the immediate development of targeted interventions by the African governments, health ministries, research institutions, and digital health stakeholders. With these include the establishment of robust governance mechanism, ethical oversight frameworks and digital infrastructure as investment. In the future, it is suggested that longitudinal study and cross regional policy comparison should be conducted to provide sufficient support for sustainability of AI integration in healthcare systems.</p>",

With thousands of strains sequenced to date, SARS-CoV-2 mutations pose significant challenges to scientists on keeping pace with vaccine development and public health measures. Therefore, an efficient method of identifying the divergence of lab samples from patients would greatly aid the documentation of SARS-CoV-2 genomics. In this study, we propose a neural network model that leverages recurrent and convolutional units to directly take in amino acid sequences of spike proteins and classify corresponding clades. We also compared our model's performance with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pre-trained on protein database.

      "abstract": "Non-linear interactions among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes, and pathways play an important role in human diseases, but identifying these interactions is a challenging task. Neural networks are state-of-the-art predictors in many domains due to their ability to analyze big data and model complex patterns, including non-linear interactions. In genetics, visible neural networks are gaining popularity as they provide insight into the most important SNPs, genes and pathways for prediction. Visible neural networks use prior knowledge (e.g. gene and pathway annotations) to define the connections between nodes in the network, making them sparse and interpretable. Currently, most of these networks provide measures for the importance of SNPs, genes, and pathways but lack details on the nature of the interactions. In this paper, we explore different methods to detect non-linear interactions with visible neural networks. We adapted and sped up existing methods, created a comprehensive benchmark with simulated data from GAMETES and EpiGEN, and demonstrated that these methods can extract multiple types of interactions from trained visible neural networks. Finally, we applied these methods to a genome-wide case-control study of inflammatory bowel disease and found high consistency of the epistasis pairs candidates between the interpretation methods. The follow-up association test on these candidate pairs identified seven significant epistasis pairs.",

      "abstract": "An early genetic diagnosis can guide the time-sensitive treatment and care of individuals with genetic epilepsies. However, identification of a genetic cause often occurs long after onset of these disorders. Here, we aimed to identify early clinical features suggestive of genetic diagnoses in individuals with epilepsy by systematic large-scale analysis of clinical information from full-text patient notes in the electronic medical records (EMR). From the EMR of 32,112 individuals with childhood epilepsy, we retrieved 4,572,783 clinical notes spanning 203,369 total patient-years. A subcohort of 1,925 individuals had a known or presumed genetic epilepsy with 738 genetic diagnoses spanning 271 genes. We employed a customized natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract 89 million time-stamped standardized clinical annotations from free text of the retrieved clinical notes. Our analyses identified 47,641 clinical associations with a genetic cause at distinct ages prior to diagnosis. Notable among these associations were: SCN1A with status epilepticus between 9 and 12 months of age ( P <0.0001, 95% CI=8.10-133); STXBP1 with muscular hypotonia between 6 and 9 months ( P =3.4×10 −4 , 95% CI=3.08-102); SCN2A with autism between 1.5 and 1.75 years ( P <0.0001, 95% CI=11.1-Inf); DEPDC5 with focal-onset seizure between 5.75 and 6 years ( P <0.0001, 95% CI=12.8-Inf); and IQSEC2 with myoclonic seizure between 2.75 and 3 years ( P =2.5×10 −4 , 95% CI=11.3-1.15×10 4 ). We also identified associations between clinical terms and gene groups. Variants in ion channel gating mechanisms were associated with myoclonus between 3 and 6 months of age ( P <0.0001, 95% CI=5.23-24.2), and variants in calcium channel genes were associated with neurodevelopmental delay between 1.75 and 2 years ( P <0.0001, 95% CI=4.8-Inf). Cumulative longitudinal analysis revealed further associations, including KCNT1 with migrating focal seizures from at 0 to 1.75 years ( P <0.0001, 95% CI=96.8-4.50×10 15 ). A neurodevelopmental abnormality presenting between 6 and 9 months of age was strongly associated with an individual having any genetic diagnosis ( P <0.0001, 95% CI=3.55-7.42). The earliest features associated with genetic diagnosis occurred a median of 3.6 years prior to the median age of diagnosis. Latency to diagnosis was greater in older individuals ( P <0.0001) and those who initially underwent less comprehensive genetic testing ( P =5.5×10 −3 , 95% CI=1.23-3.35). In summary, we identified key clinical features that precede genetic diagnosis, leveraging EMR data at scale from a large cohort of individuals with genetic epilepsies. Our findings demonstrate that automated EMR analysis may assist clinical decision making, leading to earlier diagnosis and more precise prognostication and treatment of genetic epilepsies in the precision medicine era.",

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, with the vast majority having unknown functional consequences. Here we present the first large-scale experimental analysis of human missense variants across many different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset, Human Domainome 1, reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. Combining stability measurements with protein language models annotates functional sites across proteins. Mutational effects on stability are largely conserved in homologous domains, allowing accurate stability prediction across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Cancers evolve obeying Darwinian laws and therefore the evolutionary paradigm lays the ground for predictive oncology. However, the predictive power of evolutionary metrics in cancer has been seldom tested. There is a need for quantitative measurements in controlled clinical trials with long term follow-up information. This is particularly true in locally-advanced prostate cancer, which can recur more than a decade after diagnosis. Here we mapped genomic intra-tumour heterogeneity in 642 samples from 114 patients who took part in the prostate radiotherapy trials at The Royal Marsden Hospital, for which full clinical information and 12y median follow-up was available. We concomitantly assessed phenotypic (morphological) heterogeneity using deep learning in 1,923 histological sections from 250 IMRT patients (fully overlapping with the genetic set). We found that evolvability, measured as genetic divergence as well as morphological diversity, was a strong independent predictor of recurrence (respectively HR=72.06, 95% CI 2.97-1748.5, p=0.009 and HR=6.2, 95% CI 1.86-20.72, p=0.003). Combined, these two measurements together also identified a group of patients with half the median time to recurrence compared to the rest of the cohort (5.6 vs 11.5 years). We also found a small subset of MYC/FGFR1 amplified cases (4.4%) with particularly poor prognosis. The overall burden of chromosomal alterations correlated with higher Gleason score. We identified associations between 24 chromosomal arm copy number changes and Gleason score (e.g. -22q, +5p, +8q, +16p, +7p), and show that loss of chromosome 6p (encompassing the HLA locus) was correlated with markedly reduced immune cell infiltration. This study shows that combining genomics with AI-aided histopathology in clinical trials leads to the identification of novel clinical biomarkers.</p>",

      "abstract": "Predictive modeling often uses black box machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks, to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In scientific domains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually important for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly follow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on discoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs enable important features to be discovered with control of the FDR. However, knockoffs require rich generative models capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they obey the so-called \"swap\" property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs (DDLK), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap property. DDLK consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit likelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint distribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure that the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, DDLK uses the Gumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case swap. We find DDLK has higher power than baselines while controlling the false discovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task involving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To discover candidate drugs to repurpose for COVID-19 using literature-derived knowledge and knowledge graph completion methods. Methods: We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from both PubMed and COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative subset of semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on a BERT variant, and used this subset to construct a knowledge graph. Five SOTA, neural knowledge graph completion algorithms were used to predict drug repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. Results: Accuracy classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1= 0.854) in classifying semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1=0.417). Some known drugs linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as some candidate drugs that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled generation of plausible hypotheses regarding the relationships between the candidate drugs and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (paclitaxel, SB 203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and butylated hydroxytoluene) with their mechanistic explanations were further discussed. Conclusion: We show that an LBD approach can be feasible for discovering drug candidates for COVID-19, and for generating mechanistic explanations. Our approach can be generalized to other diseases as well as to other clinical questions.",

In this paper, we describe our work that attempts to go beyond bibliometric metadata to predict influential scholarly documents. Furthermore, this work also examines the influential scholarly document prediction task over categorized scholarly documents. We also introduce a new approach to enhance the document representation method with domain independent knowledge graph to find the influential scholarly document using categorized scholarly content. As the input collection, we use the WHO corpus with scholarly documents on the theme of COVID-19. This study examines different document representation methods for machine learning, including TF-IDF, BOW, and embedding-based language models (BERT). The TF-IDF document representation method works better than others. From various machine learning methods tested, logistic regression outperformed the other for scholarly document category classification, and the random forest algorithm obtained the best results for influential scholarly document prediction, with the help of a domain-independent knowledge graph, specifically DBpedia, to enhance the document representation method for predicting influential scholarly documents with categorical scholarly content. In this case, our study combines state-of-the-art machine learning methods with the BOW document representation method. We also enhance the BOW document representation with the direct type (rdf type) and unqualified relation from DBpedia. From this experiment, we did not find any impact of the enhanced document representation for the scholarly document category classification.

      "abstract": "Long-range spatial interactions among genomic regions are critical for regulating gene expression, and their disruption has been associated with a host of diseases. However, when modeling the effects of regulatory factors, most deep learning models either neglect long-range interactions or fail to capture the inherent 3D structure of the underlying genomic organization. To address these limitations, we present GC-MERGE, a G raph C onvolutional M odel for E pigenetic R egulation of G ene E xpression. Using a graph-based framework, the model incorporates important information about long-range interactions via a natural encoding of spatial interactions into the graph representation. It integrates measurements of both the spatial genomic organization and local regulatory factors, specifically histone modifications, to not only predict the expression of a given gene of interest but also quantify the importance of its regulatory factors. We apply GC-MERGE to datasets for three cell lines - GM12878 (lymphoblastoid), K562 (myelogenous leukemia), and HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial) - and demonstrate its state-of-the-art predictive performance. Crucially, we show that our model is interpretable in terms of the observed biological regulatory factors, high-lighting both the histone modifications and the interacting genomic regions contributing to a gene’s predicted expression. We provide model explanations for multiple exemplar genes and validate them with evidence from the literature. Our model presents a novel setup for predicting gene expression by integrating multimodal datasets in a graph convolutional framework. More importantly, it enables interpretation of the biological mechanisms driving the model’s predictions. Available at: https://github.com/rsinghlab/GC-MERGE .",

      "title": "Viro3D: a comprehensive database of virus protein structure predictions",
      "abstract": "Viruses are intracellular parasites of organisms from all domains of life. They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D ( https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/ ), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.",

This contains 166,691 neurons spanning the brain and nerve cord, fully proofread and annotated including  fruitless /  doublesex expression and 11,691 types. We provide the first comprehensive comparison between male and female brain connectomes to synaptic resolution, finding 7,205 isomorphic, 114 dimorphic, 262 male-specific and 69 female-specific types. This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours and the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific/dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic. Within higher centres, male-specific connections are organised into hotspots defined by male-specific neurons or arbours. Numerous circuit switches reroute sensory information to form antagonistic circuits controlling opposing behaviours.",

Strikingly, this analysis demonstrates that claimed TCR reactivity is only confirmed for 50% of evaluated entries. Intriguingly, the use of TCRbridge to analyze AlphaFold3 confidence metrics reveals a substantial performance in distinguishing functionally validating and non-validating TCRs even though AlphaFold3 was not trained on this task, demonstrating the utility of the validated VDJdb (TCRvdb) database that we generated.

      "abstract": "Immune cells fine tune their responses to infection and inflammatory cues. Here, using live-cell confocal microscopy and mathematical modelling, we investigate interferon induced JAK-STAT signalling in innate immune macrophages. We demonstrate that transient exposure to IFN-γ stimulation induces a long-term desensitisation of STAT1 signalling and gene expression responses, revealing a dose- and time-dependent regulatory feedback that controls JAK-STAT responses upon re-exposure to stimulus. We show that IFN-α/β1 elicit different level of desensitisation from IFN-γ, where cells refractory to IFN-α/β1 are sensitive to IFN-γ, but not vice versa . We experimentally demonstrate that the underlying feedback mechanism involves regulation of STAT1 phosphorylation but is independent of new mRNA synthesis and cognate receptor expression. A new feedback model of the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity recapitulates experimental data and demonstrates JAK-STAT network’s ability to decode relative changes of dose, timing, and type of temporal interferon stimulation. These findings reveal that STAT desensitisation renders cells with signalling memory of type I and II interferon stimulation, which in the future may improve administration of interferon therapy.",

Here, we combined intracranial recordings in humans with behavioral categorization of speech or music taken from a naturalistic movie soundtrack to test whether the encoding of spectrotemporal modulation (STM) acoustic features is sufficient to categorize the two classes. We show that primarily temporal and primarily spectral modulation patterns characterize speech and music, respectively, and that non-primary auditory regions robustly track these acoustic features over time. Critically, cortical representations of STMs predicted perceptual judgments gathered in an independent sample. Finally, speech-and music-related STM representations showed stronger tracking of category-specific acoustical features in the left versus right non-primary auditory regions, respectively. These findings support a domain-general framework for auditory categorization, such that perceptual categories emerge from efficient neural coding of low-level acoustical cues, highlighting the computational relevance of STMs in shaping auditory representations that support behavior.",

In recent years, this area has been dominated by convolutional neural networks, which typically outperform previously-designed methods as a result of automated scanning for influential sequence motifs. However, those architectures do not allow for the efficient processing of the full genomic sequence. As an improvement, we introduce transformer architectures for whole genome sequence labeling tasks. We show that these architectures, recently introduced for natural language processing, are better suited for processing and annotating long DNA sequences. We apply existing networks and introduce an optimized method for the calculation of attention from input nucleotides. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our architecture on several sequence labeling tasks, and find it to achieve state-of-the-art performances when comparing it to specialized models for the annotation of transcription start sites, translation initiation sites and 4mC methylation in E. coli .",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Target-based high-throughput compound screening dominates conventional one-drug-one-gene drug discovery process. However, the readout from the chemical modulation of a single protein is poorly correlated with phenotypic response of organism, leading to high failure rate in drug development. Chemical-induced gene expression profile provides an attractive solution to phenotype-based screening. However, the use of such data is currently limited by their sparseness, unreliability, and relatively low throughput. Several methods have been proposed to impute missing values for gene expression datasets. However, few existing methods can perform de novo chemical compound screening. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven neural network-based method named DeepCE (Deep Chemical Expression) which utilizes graph convolutional neural network to learn chemical representation and multi-head attention mechanism to model chemical substructure-gene and gene-gene feature associations. In addition, we propose a novel data augmentation method which extracts useful information from unreliable experiments in L1000 dataset. The experimental results show that DeepCE achieves the superior performances not only in de novo chemical setting but also in traditional imputation setting compared to state-of-the-art baselines for the prediction of chemical-induced gene expression. We further verify the effectiveness of gene expression profiles generated from DeepCE by comparing them with gene expression profiles in L1000 dataset for downstream classification tasks including drug-target and disease predictions. To demonstrate the value of DeepCE, we apply it to patient-specific drug repurposing of COVID-19 for the first time, and generate novel lead compounds consistent with clinical evidences. Thus, DeepCE provides a potentially powerful framework for robust predictive modeling by utilizing noisy omics data as well as screening novel chemicals for the modulation of systemic response to disease.",

      "title": "Generating hard-to-obtain information from easy-to-obtain information: applications in drug discovery and clinical inference",
      "abstract": "In many important contexts involving measurements of biological entities, there are distinct categories of information: some information is easy-to-obtain information (EI) and can be gathered on virtually every subject of interest, while other information is hard-to-obtain information (HI) and can only be gathered on some of the biological samples. For example, in the context of drug discovery, measurements like the chemical structure of a drug are EI, while measurements of the transcriptome of a cell population perturbed with the drug is HI. In the clinical context, basic health monitoring is EI because it is already being captured as part of other processes, while cellular measurements like flow cytometry or even ultimate patient outcome are HI. We propose building a model to make probabilistic predictions of HI from EI on the samples that have both kinds of measurements, which will allow us to generalize and predict the HI on a large set of samples from just the EI. To accomplish this, we present a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework we call the Feature Mapping GAN (FMGAN). By using the EI as conditions to map to the HI, we demonstrate that FMGAN can accurately predict the HI, with heterogeneity in cases of distributions of HI from EI. We show that FMGAN is flexible in that it can learn rich and complex mappings from EI to HI, and can take into account manifold structure in the EI space where available. We demonstrate this in a variety of contexts including generating RNA sequencing results on cell lines subjected to drug perturbations using drug chemical structure, and generating clinical outcomes from patient lab measurements. Most notably, we are able to generate synthetic flow cytometry data from clinical variables on a cohort of COVID-19 patients—effectively describing their immune response in great detail, and showcasing the power of generating expensive FACS data from ubiquitously available patient monitoring data. <h4>Bigger Picture</h4> Many experiments face a trade-off between gathering easy-to-collect information on many samples or hard-to-collect information on a smaller number of small due to costs in terms of both money and time. We demonstrate that a mapping between the easy-to-collect and hard-to-collect information can be trained as a conditional GAN from a subset of samples with both measured. With our conditional GAN model known as Feature-Mapping GAN (FMGAN), the results of expensive experiments can be predicted, saving on the costs of actually performing the experiment. This can have major impact in many settinsg. We study two example settings. First, in the field of pharmaceutical drug discovery early phase pharmaceutical experiments require casting a wide net to find a few potential leads to follow. In the long term, development pipelines can be re-designed to specifically utilize FMGAN in an optimal way to accelerate the process of drug discovery. FMGAN can also have a major impact in clinical setting, where routinely measured variables like blood pressure or heart rate can be used to predict important health outcomes and therefore deciding the best course of treatment.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  The relation between regional morphological features derived from the bilaterian body plan and the behaviours necessary to extract utility from such structures is not well understood. Here we use the  Drosophila larva to investigate this ‘form-function’ problem focusing on the mapping of the regional stimuli that trigger an adaptive and evolutionarily conserved behaviour termed self-righting: a postural control system that allows the animal to restore its natural position if turned upside-down. Through the development of new methodologies that allow regionally-restricted mechanical stimulation and region-specific neuronal optogenetics, we find that multidendritic sensory neuron inhibition in anterior areas (thoracic/anterior abdominal) has a profound effect on self-righting performance, whilst inhibition of posterior sensory elements (mid and posterior abdomen) produces no effects. We then applied a deep neural network tracking method to examine how neuronal inhibition affected the different subcomponents of the self-righting sequence and learned that inhibition of anterior sensory neurons primarily increases head casting behaviour, and that this is strongly correlated with abnormally long self-righting times. Furthermore, to explore the mechanistic bases of our behavioural observations, we considered the hypothesis that the  Hox genes – well known for their roles in axial developmental patterning – might play a role in the functional specification of multidendritic sensory neurons along the body axis. Molecular expression analysis of FACS-sorted neural populations, fluorescent immunolabelling and neuron-specific knock-down experiments demonstrate that normal sensory neuron expression of the  Hox genes  Antennapedia and  Abdominal-b is necessary for self-righting in the  Drosophila larva. Altogether, our work shows that region-specific mechanosensory processes mediated by multidendritic sensory neurons and instructed via  Hox gene inputs are essential for self-righting, providing a link between regional structural features and an adaptive and widely evolutionarily conserved postural control behaviour.",

Networks estimated from pairwise similarities of 40 sulci on 5 morphological metrics comprised two clusters of sulci, represented also by the bipolar distribution of sulci on a linear-to-complex dimension. Linear sulci were more heritable and typically located in unimodal cortex; complex sulci were less heritable and typically located in heteromodal cortex. Aligning these results with an independent fetal brain MRI cohort (N=228; 21-36 gestational weeks), we found that linear sulci formed earlier, and the earliest and latest-forming sulci had the least between-adult variation. Using high-resolution maps of cortical gene expression, we found that linear sulcation is mechanistically underpinned by trans-sulcal gene expression gradients enriched for developmental processes.",

However, the underlying functional dynamics of the neural networks mediating such crossmodal responses remain unclear. Here, using braille reading as a model framework to investigate these networks, we presented sighted (N=13) and blind (N=12) readers with individual visual print and tactile braille alphabetic letters, respectively, during MEG recording. Using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis, we traced the alphabetic letter processing cascade in both groups of participants. We found that letter representations unfolded more slowly in blind than in sighted brains, with decoding peak latencies ∼200 ms later in braille readers. Focusing on the blind group, we found that the format of neural letter representations transformed within the first 500 ms after stimulus onset from a low-level structure consistent with peripheral nerve afferent coding to high-level format reflecting pairwise letter embeddings in a text corpus. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the transformation suggest that the processing cascade proceeds from a starting point in somatosensory cortex to early visual cortex and then to inferotemporal cortex. Together our results give insight into the neural mechanisms underlying braille reading in blind persons and the dynamics of functional reorganization in sensory deprivation.",

Despite the progress in sequencing and CRISPR technologies, proteome-wide mutation effect prediction remains challenging. Here, we introduce ProteoCast, a scalable and interpretable computational method for proteome-wide classification of genetic variants and functional protein site identification. It relies solely on evolutionary information, leveraging protein sequence data across organisms. <bold>Results:</bold> Using ProteoCast, we generated mutational landscapes for 22,169 Drosophila melanogaster protein isoforms, categorising over 293 million amino acid substitutions as functionally neutral, uncertain, or impactful. We validated our predictions with over 380 thousand natural polymorphisms observed in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and Drosophila Evolution over Space and Time (DEST) datasets and with FlyBase's developmentally lethal mutations. About 86% of known lethal mutations were classified as impactful or uncertain, versus only 13% and 18% of DGRP and DEST mutations. Moreover, we performed ProteoCastguided genome editing experiments, providing a proof-of-concept of the validity of this strategy. Beyond variant effect prediction, ProteoCast detected evolutionary conservation signals in about one-third of 40.5K annotated post-translational modification sites and 83% of ~90 known short linear motifs. These results support its usefulness for uncovering interaction and regulatory sites in unstructured protein regions. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results demonstrate ProteoCast applicability for model organisms, contributing to basic genetic research and translational studies.

      "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved many high-risk variants, resulting in repeated COVID-19 waves of pandemic during the past years. Therefore, accurate early-warning of high-risk variants is vital for epidemic prevention and control. Here we construct a machine learning model to predict high-risk variants of SARS-CoV-2 by LightGBM algorithm based on several important haplotype network features. As demonstrated on a series of different retrospective testing datasets, our model achieves accurate prediction of all variants of concern (VOC) and most variants of interest (AUC=0.96). Prediction based on the latest sequences shows that the newly emerging lineage BA.5 has the highest risk score and spreads rapidly to become a major epidemic lineage in multiple countries, suggesting that BA.5 bears great potential to be a VOC. In sum, our machine learning model is capable to early predict high-risk variants soon after their emergence, thus greatly improving public health preparedness against the evolving virus.",

      "title": "Ciliary tip actin dynamics regulate the cadence of photoreceptor disc formation",
      "abstract": "As signalling organelles, primary cilia regulate their membrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) content by ectocytosis, a process requiring localised actin dynamics at their tip to alter membrane shape.(1, 2) Mammalian photoreceptor outer segments comprise an expanse of folded membranes (discs) at the tip of highly-specialised connecting cilia (CC), in which photosensitive GPCRs like rhodopsin are concentrated. In an extraordinary feat of biology, outer segment discs are shed and remade daily.(3) Defects in this process, due to genetic mutations, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an untreatable, blinding disease. The mechanism by which photoreceptor cilia generate outer segments is therefore fundamental for vision yet poorly understood. Here, we show the membrane deformation required for outer segment disc genesis is driven by dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton in a process akin to ectocytosis. Further, we show RPGR , a leading causal RP gene, regulates activity of actin binding proteins crucial to this process. Disc genesis is compromised in Rpgr mouse models, slowing the actin dynamics required for timely disc formation, leading to aborted membrane shedding as ectosome-like vesicles, photoreceptor death and visual loss. Manipulation of actin dynamics partially rescues the phenotype, suggesting this pathway could be targeted therapeutically. These findings help define how actin-mediated dynamics control outer segment turnover.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-2019 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (aka 2019-nCoV) has raised significant health concerns in China and worldwide. While novel drug discovery and vaccine studies are long, repurposing old drugs against the COVID-2019 epidemic can help identify treatments, with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles, which can rapidly enter Phase 3 or 4 or can be used directly in clinical settings. In this study, we presented a novel network based drug repurposing platform to identify potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-2019. We first analysed the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and identified SARS as the closest disease, based on genome similarity between both causal viruses, followed by MERS and other human coronavirus diseases. Using our AutoSeed pipeline (text mining and database searches), we obtained 34 COVID-2019-related genes. Taking those genes as seeds, we automatically built a molecular network for which our module detection and drug prioritization algorithms identified 24 disease-related human pathways, five modules and finally suggested 78 drugs to repurpose. Following manual filtering based on clinical knowledge, we re-prioritized 30 potential repurposable drugs against COVID-2019 (including pseudoephedrine, andrographolide, chloroquine, abacavir, and thalidomide) . We hope that this data can provide critical insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and help design rapid clinical trials of treatments against COVID-2019.",

      "title": "Predicting Hydroxyl Mediated Nucleophilic Degradation and Molecular Stability of RNA Sequences through the Application of Deep Learning Methods",
      "abstract": "Synthesis and efficient implementation mRNA strands has been shown to have wide utility, especially recently in the development of COVID vaccines. However, the intrinsic chemical stability of mRNA poses a challenge due to the presence of 2'-hydroxyl groups in ribose sugars. The -OH group in the backbone structure enables a base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated hydroxyl on the adjacent phosphorous and consequent self-hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond. As expected for in-line hydrolytic cleavage reactions, the chemical stability of mRNA strands is highly dependent on external environmental factors, e.g. pH, temperature, oxidizers, etc. Predicting this chemical instability using a computational model will reduce the number of sequences synthesized and tested through identifying the most promising candidates, aiding the development of mRNA related therapies. This paper proposes and evaluates three deep learning models (Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Graph Convolutional Networks) as methods to predict the reactivity and risk of degradation of mRNA sequences. The Stanford Open Vaccine dataset of 6034 mRNA sequences was used in this study. The training set consisted of 3029 of these sequences (length of 107 nucleotide bases) while the testing dataset consisted of 3005 sequences (length of 130 nucleotide bases), in structured (Lowest Entropy Base Pair Probability Matrix) and unstructured (Nodes and Edges) forms. The stability of mRNA strands was accurately generated, with the Graph Convolutional Network being the best predictor of reactivity ($RMSE = 0.249$) while the Gated Recurrent Unit Network was the best at predicting risks of degradation ($RMSE = 0.266$). Combining all target variables, the GRU performed the best with 76% accuracy. Results suggest these models can be applied to understand and predict the chemical stability of mRNA in the near future.",

      "title": "A Pan-Coronavirus Vaccine Candidate: Nine Amino Acid Substitutions in the ORF1ab Gene Attenuate 99% of 365 Unique Coronaviruses: A Comparative Effectiveness Research Study",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> The COVID-19 pandemic has been a watershed event. Industry and governments have reacted, investing over US$105 billion in vaccine research. 1 The ‘Holy Grail’ is a universal, pan-coronavirus, vaccine to protect humankind from future SARS-CoV-2 variants and the thousands of similar coronaviruses with pandemic potential. 2 This paper proposes a new vaccine candidate that appears to attenuate the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus variants to render it safe to use as a vaccine. Moreover, these results indicate it may be efficacious against 99% of 365 coronaviruses. This research model is wet-dry-wet; it originated in genomic sequencing laboratories, evolved to computational modeling, and the candidate result now require validation back in a wet lab. <h4>Objectives</h4> This study’s purpose was to test the hypothesis that machine learning applied to sequenced coronaviruses’ genomes could identify which amino acid substitutions likely attenuate the viruses to produce a safe and effective pan-coronavirus vaccine candidate. This candidate is now eligible to be pre-clinically then clinically tested and proven. If validated, it would constitute a traditional attenuated virus vaccine to protect against hundreds of coronaviruses, including the many future variants of SARS-CoV-2 predicted from continuously recombining in unvaccinated populations and spreading by modern mass travel. <h4>Methods</h4> Using machine learning, this was an in silico comparative effectiveness research study on trinucleotide functions in nonstructural proteins of 365 novel coronavirus genomes. Sequences of 7,097 codons in the ORF1ab gene were collected from 65 global locations infecting 68 species and reported to the US National Institute of Health. The data were proprietarily transformed twice to enable machine learning ingestion, mapping, and interpretation. The set of 2,590,405 data points was randomly divided into three cohorts: 255 (70%) observations for training; and two cohorts of 55 (15%) observations each for testing. Machine learning models were trained in the statistical programming language R and compared to identify which mixture of the 7.097 × 10 23 possible amino-acid-location combinations would attenuate SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that have infected humans. <h4>Results</h4> Contests of machine-learning algorithms identified nine amino-acid point substitutions in the ORF1ab gene that likely attenuate 98.98% of 365 (361) novel coronaviruses. Notably, seven substitutions are for the amino acid alanine. Most of the locations (5 of 9) are in nonstructural proteins (NSPs) 2 and 3. The substitutions are alanine to (1) valine at codon 4273; (2) leucine at codon 5077; (3) phenylalanine at codon 2001; (4) leucine at codon 372; (5) proline at codon 354; (6) phenylalanine at codon 2811; (7) phenylalanine at codon 4703; (8) leucine to serine at codon 2333; and, (9) threonine to alanine at codon 5131. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The primary outcome is a new, highly promising, pan-coronavirus vaccine candidate based on nine amino-acid substitutions in the ORF1ab gene. The secondary outcome was evidence that sequences of wet-dry lab collaborations – here machine learning analysis of viral genomes informing codon functions -- may discover new broader and more stable vaccines candidates more quickly and inexpensively than traditional methods.",

      "title": "Probing the Biological Underpinnings of Advanced Brain Ageing in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Recent evidence suggests that patients with schizophrenia may show advanced brain ageing, particularly evident after the first year of onset. However, it is unclear if accelerated ageing relents, persists or continues to increase over time. The underlying causal factors are also poorly understood. Disruptions in glutamate function, oxidative stress, and inflammation may all contribute to progressive brain changes in people with schizophrenia. We examine whether brain ageing differs between early and established stages of schizophrenia, correlates with symptom severity and varies with markers of brain function, oxidative status and inflammatory burden. <h4>Methods</h4> Two brain-age prediction models assessed 112 participants (34 recent onset psychosis, 36 established schizophrenia, 42 healthy controls). Brain age gap (BAG) was calculated by subtracting chronological age from predicted age. Shapley’s additive explanations (SHAP) identified influential structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features driving brain-age prediction. Linear regression models and partial correlations, adjusting for age, explored associations between BAG and neurometabolites, inflammatory markers, medication exposure and clinical scores in the whole sample. <h4>Results</h4> The established schizophrenia group showed higher BAG (Mean = 6.21, SD = 7.30) compared to healthy individuals (Mean = -0.01, SD = 9.10), while recent-onset patients (Mean = 4.23, SD = 9.25) did not differ significantly from healthy individuals. The top 10 SHAP features diving the BAG included ventricular enlargement and total grey matter volume, which was similar in psychosis to healthy individuals. In a combined psychosis group (established + recent-onset), higher BAG correlated with more severe symptoms (PANSS total, general, and anxiodepressive subscales). BAG positively associated with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy measured glutathione and negatively with N-Acetyl Aspartate. <h4>Discussion</h4> Accelerated brain age in schizophrenia may be related to illness severity and poor defence against oxidative stress. The lack of differences in SHAP features between schizophrenia and healthy individuals suggests that the pattern of brain ageing is in keeping with advanced normal ageing. Findings suggest potential treatment targets to improve brain health in schizophrenia, warranting further research.",

      "abstract": "Estimating the future course of cancer is invaluable to physicians; however, current clinical methods fail to effectively use the vast amount of multimodal data that is available for cancer patients. To tackle this problem, we constructed a deep neural network based model to predict the survival of patients for 20 different cancer types using gene expressions, microRNA data, clinical data and histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). We developed an unsupervised encoder to compress these four data modalities into a single feature vector for each patient, handling missing data through a resilient, multimodal dropout method. Encoding methods were tailored to each data type - using deep highway networks to extract features from genomic and clinical data, and convolutional neural networks extract features from pathology images. We then used these feature encodings trained on pancancer data to predict pancancer and single cancer survival data, achieving a C-index of 0.784 overall. This work shows that it is possible to build a pancancer model for prognosis that also predicts prognosis in single cancer sites. Furthermore, our model handles multiple data modalities, efficiently analyzes WSIs, and summarizes patient details flexibly into an unsupervised, informative profile. We thus present a powerful automated tool to accurately determine prognosis, a key step towards personalized treatment for cancer patients.",

Two compounds, 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib, showed synergistic antiviral effects in our in vitro experiments, and strongly inhibited viral-induced syncytia formation.

We present a new annotated corpus of chest radiograph reports and introduce the Hierarchical Attention Network with Sentence Objectives (HANSO) text classification framework. HANSO utilizes fine-grained annotations to improve document classification performance. HANSO can extract ARDS-related information with high performance by leveraging relation annotations, even if the annotated spans are noisy. Using annotated chest radiograph images as a gold standard, HANSO identifies bilateral infiltrates, an indicator of ARDS, in chest radiograph reports with performance (0.87 F1) comparable to human annotations (0.84 F1).

      "abstract": "The flood of conflicting COVID-19 research has revealed that COVID-19 continues to be an enigma. Although more than 14,000 research articles on COVID-19 have been published with the disease taking a pandemic proportion, clinicians and researchers are struggling to distill knowledge for furthering clinical management and research. In this study, we address this gap for a targeted user group, i.e. clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by applying natural language processing to develop a CovidNLP dashboard in order to speed up knowledge discovery. The WHO has created a repository of about more than 5000 peer-reviewed and curated research articles on varied aspects including epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, social factors, and economics. We summarised all the articles in the WHO Database through an extractive summarizer followed by an exploration of the feature space using word embeddings which were then used to visualize the summarized associations of COVID-19 as found in the text. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will not only discover the direct effects of COVID-19 but also the systematic implications such as the anticipated rise in TB and cancer mortality due to the non-availability of drugs during the export lockdown as highlighted by our models. These demonstrate the utility of mining massive literature with natural language processing for rapid distillation and knowledge updates. This can help the users understand, synthesize, and take pre-emptive action with the available peer-reviewed evidence on COVID-19. Our models will be continuously updated with new literature and we have made our resource CovidNLP publicly available in a user-friendly fashion at http://covidnlp.tavlab.iiitd.edu.in/ . <h4>Data Availability Statement</h4> All the data used in this study are publicly available from the WHO Covid-19 Global Literature on coronavirus disease maintained at https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/ .

Unlike single-layer network methods, MultiCens can distinguish within- vs. across-layer connectivity to quantify the “influence” of any gene in a tissue on a query set of genes of interest in another tissue. MultiCens enjoys theoretical guarantees on convergence and decomposability, and excels on synthetic benchmarks. On human multi-tissue datasets, MultiCens predicts known and novel genes linked to hormones. MultiCens further reveals shifts in gene network architecture among four brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease.

      "abstract": "The adult brain is made up of anatomically and functionally distinct regions with specific neuronal compositions. At the root of this neuronal diversity are neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) that produce many neurons throughout embryonic development. During development, NPCs switch from initial expanding divisions to neurogenic divisions, which marks the onset of neurogenesis. Here, we aimed to understand when NPCs switch division modes to generate the first neurons in the anterior-most part of the zebrafish brain, the telencephalon. To this end, we used the deep learning-based segmentation method Cellpose and clonal analysis of individual NPCs to assess production of neurons by NPCs in the first 24 hours of zebrafish telencephalon development. Our results provide a quantitative atlas detailing the production of telencephalic neurons and NPC division modes between 14 and 24 hours post-fertilization. We find that within this timeframe, the switch to neurogenesis is gradual, with considerable heterogeneity in individual NPC neurogenic potential and division rates. This quantitative characterization of initial neurogenesis in the zebrafish telencephalon establishes a basis for future studies aimed at illuminating the molecular mechanisms and regulators of early neurogenesis.",

It is unclear how this spatio-temporal process is orchestrated – namely, to what extent the spread of pathologic tau is governed by transport between brain regions, local production or both. To address this, we develop a mechanistic model from tau PET data to describe tau dynamics along the Alzheimer’s disease timeline. Our analysis reveals longitudinal changes in production and transport dynamics on two independent cohorts, with subjects in early stage of the disease exhibiting transport-dominated spread, consistent with an initial spread of pathologic tau seeds, and subjects in late stage disease (Braak stage 3/4 onwards) characterised primarily by local production of tau. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can accurately predict subject-specific longitudinal tau accumulation at a regional level, potentially providing a new clinical tool to monitor and classify patient disease progression. <h4>Teaser</h4> A mechanistic model reveals tau protein dynamics in Alzheimer’s, showing stage-specific shifts in transport and local production.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Producing an adequate food supply to a growing population sustainably is challenging. Despite high-level recommendations for a shift to plant-based diets in most countries, global meat production continues to rise. Yet, we lack a comprehensive geospatial understanding of trade-offs between crops and livestock production efficiency. To address this, we developed a method to examine whether certain grazing lands could be more efficiently used for crop production and quantified the most efficient production system for each agricultural area globally. We found that the largest potential for increased protein production would be to turn grazing land into cropland near existing crop regions, such as the vertical belt stretching from Texas to South Dakota in the US, Southern Chad and South Sudan, Sichuan and Heilongjiang provinces in China. Here, large agricultural areas that are currently used for livestock grazing show strong potential for high protein yields through crop production. By converting all grazing lands to croplands that are at least moderately suitable for crop production (based on our crop suitability assessment), the total protein production could more than triple. Similarly, for grazing lands classified as highly suitable, the rise would still be 48%. Although sustainability factors such as biodiversity and climate impacts warrant further analysis, our study identifies key areas for consideration in strategic planning and policy decisions related to increasing food production.</p>",

      "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and leading cause of neurological infection in Asia and the Pacific, with recent emergence in multiple territories in Australia in 2022. Patients may experience devastating socioeconomic consequences; JEV infection (JE) predominantly affects children in poor rural areas, has a 20-30% case fatality rate, and 30-50% of survivors suffer long-term disability. JEV RNA is rarely detected in patient samples, and the standard diagnostic test is an anti-JEV IgM ELISA with sub-optimal specificity; there is no means of detection in more remote areas. We aimed to test the hypothesis that there is a diagnostic protein signature of JE in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and contribute to understanding of the host response and predictors of outcome during infection. We retrospectively tested a cohort of 163 patients recruited as part of the Laos central nervous system infection study. Application of liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), using extensive offline fractionation and tandem mass tag labelling, enabled a comparison of the CSF proteome in 68 JE patient vs 95 non-JE neurological infections. 5,070 proteins were identified, including 4,805 human proteins and 265 pathogen proteins. We incorporated univariate analysis of differential protein expression, network analysis and machine learning techniques to build a ten-protein diagnostic signature of JE with >99% diagnostic accuracy. Pathways related to JE infection included neuronal damage, anti-apoptosis, heat shock and unfolded protein responses, cell adhesion, macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as a reduced acute inflammatory response, hepatotoxicity, activation of coagulation, extracellular matrix and actin regulation. We verified the results by performing DIA LC-MS/MS in 16 (10%) of the samples, demonstrating 87% accuracy using the same model. Ultimately, antibody-based validation will be required, in a larger group of patients, in different locations and in field settings, to refine the list to 2-3 proteins that could be harnessed in a rapid diagnostic test. <h4>Author summary</h4> Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a leading cause of brain infection in Asia and the Pacific, with recent introduction in multiple territories in Australia in 2022. Patients may experience devastating socioeconomic consequences; JEV infection (JE) predominantly affects children in poor rural areas, has a 20-30% case fatality rate, and 30-50% of survivors suffer long-term disability. The disease is difficult to diagnose, and there are no rapid tests that may be performed in remote areas that it exists such that we remain unclear of the burden of disease and the effects of control measures. We aimed to apply a relatively novel method to analyse the proteins in patients with JE as compared to other neurological infections, to see if this could be useful for making a diagnosis. We tested the brain fluid of 163 patients recruited as part of the Laos central nervous system infection study. We used a method, ‘liquid chromatography mass spectrometry’ that does not require prior knowledge of the proteins present, that is you do not target any specific protein. Over 5,000 proteins were identified, and these were analysed by various methods. We grouped the proteins into different clusters that provided insight into their function. We also filtered the list to 10 proteins that predicted JE as compared to other brain infections. Future work will require confirmation of the findings in a larger group of patients, in different locations and in field settings, to refine the list to 2-3 proteins that could be harnessed in a rapid diagnostic test.",

      "abstract": "The success of deep learning has been shown in various fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and bioinformatics. The advance of Deep Learning in Computer Vision has been an important source of inspiration for other research fields. The objective of this work is to adapt known deep learning models borrowed from computer vision such as VGGNet, Resnet and AlexNet for the classification of biological sequences. In particular, we are interested by the task of splice site identification based on raw DNA sequences. We focus on the role of model architecture depth on model training and classification performance. We show that deep learning models outperform traditional classification methods (SVM, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression) for large training sets of raw DNA sequences. Three model families are analyzed in this work namely VGGNet, AlexNet and ResNet. Three depth levels are defined for each model family. The models are benchmarked using the following metrics: Area Under ROC curve (AUC), Number of model parameters, number of floating operations. Our extensive experimental evaluation show that shallow architectures have an overall better performance than deep models. We introduced a shallow version of ResNet, named S-ResNet. We show that it gives a good trade-off between model complexity and classification performance. <h4>Author summary</h4> Deep Learning has been widely applied to various fields in research and industry. It has been also succesfully applied to genomics and in particular to splice site identification. We are interested in the use of advanced neural networks borrowed from computer vision.

      "title": "CovIn-Net: Classification of COVID-19 and Influenza-A Metabolic Pathways Using Three Parallel CNN Branches Based on Genetic Images",
      "abstract": "The occurrence and development of viral diseases are highly correlated with the abnormal biological function of metabolic pathways. Predicting viral metabolic pathways aims to minimize chemical production by optimizing the genetics of the viruses. This paper investigates Covid-19 and Influenza-A metabolic pathways based on gene sequences. The primary focus of this work is to promote early detection, automated diagnosis tools, drug design, and treatment of deadly viruses. As both viruses are so similar in signs and symptoms, capturing variations in the genomic data that classify the two viruses’ pathways is critical and difficult. Furthermore, for the identification of various diseases, existing work has classified the DNA sequences of different viruses based on the K-mers technique. However, there is a high degree of ambiguity due to a large number of vertices of high-dimensional data. To address this challenge, this paper presents an image transformation-based model called CovIn-Net. The pipeline of CovIn-Net contains four stages. In the first stage, genetic images are constructed using DeepInsight methods by converting gene sequences into images by assigning features to pixel position. The second stage consists of three parallel CNN branches with different initialization weights to extract multi-scale features from genetic images with effective abstraction levels. We merge three parallel branches in the third stage to create feature fusion path. Metabolic pathways are then classified based on the multi-scaled extracted features. Experiments verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that CovIn-Net provides 98.48% accuracy, 99.83% precision, 96.64% recall, and 98.29% F1-score compared to other investigated CNN architectures such as single-branch, double-branch model, and CNN based on K-mers techniques.",

      "abstract": "The global spread of COVID-19 seriously endangers human health and even lives. By predicting patients’ individualized disease development and further performing intervention in time, we may rationalize scarce medical resources and reduce mortality. Based on 1337 multi-stage (≥3) high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) images of 417 infected patients from three centers in the epidemic area, we proposed a random forest + cellular automata (RF+CA) model to forecast voxel-level lesion development of patients with COVID-19. The model showed a promising prediction performance (Dice similarity coefficient [DSC] = 71.1%, Kappa coefficient = 0.612, Figure of Merit [FoM] = 0.257, positional accuracy [PA] = 3.63) on the multicenter dataset. Using this model, multiple driving factors for the development of lesions were determined, such as distance to various interstitials in the lung, distance to the pleura, etc. The driving processes of these driving factors were further dissected and explained in depth from the perspective of pathophysiology, to explore the mechanism of individualized development of COVID-19 disease.

      "title": "Identification of a serum proteomic biomarker panel using diagnosis specific ensemble learning and symptoms for early pancreatic cancer detection",
      "abstract": "<h4>BACKGROUND</h4> The grim (<10% 5-year) survival rates for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are attributed to its complex intrinsic biology and most often late-stage detection. The overlap of symptoms with benign gastrointestinal conditions in early stage further complicates timely detection. The suboptimal diagnostic performance of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and elevation in benign hyperbilirubinaemia undermine its reliability, leaving a notable absence of accurate diagnostic biomarkers. Using a selected patient cohort with benign pancreatic and biliary tract conditions we aimed to develop a biomarker signature capable of distinguishing patients with non-specific yet concerning clinical presentations, from those with PDAC. <h4>METHODS</h4> 539 patient serum samples collected under the Accelerated Diagnosis of neuro Endocrine and Pancreatic TumourS (ADEPTS) study (benign disease controls and PDACs) and the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS, healthy controls) were screened using the Olink Oncology II panel, supplemented with five in-house markers. 16 specialized base-learner classifiers were stacked to select and enhance biomarker performances and robustness in blinded samples. Each base-learner was constructed through cross-validation and recursive feature elimination in a discovery set comprising approximately two thirds of the ADEPTS and UKCTOCS samples and contrasted specific diagnosis with PDAC. <h4>RESULTS</h4> The signature which was developed using diagnosis-specific ensemble learning demonstrated predictive capabilities outperforming CA19-9 and individual biomarkers in both discovery and validation sets. An AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98 – 0.99) and sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98 - 1) at 90% specificity was achieved with the ensemble method, which was significantly larger than the AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66 - 0.91) and sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI 0.50 - 0.83), also at 90% specificity, for CA19- 9, in the discovery set (p=0.0016 and p=0.00050, respectively). During ensemble signature validation, an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 – 0.99), sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI 0.68 - 1), was attained compared to an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66 – 0.93), sensitivity 0.65 (95% CI 0.48 – 0.56) at 90% specificity for CA19-9 alone (p=0.0082 and p=0.024, respectively). When validated only on the benign disease controls and PDACs collected from ADEPTS, the diagnostic-specific signature achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 – 0.99), sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.64 – 0.95) at 90% specificity, which was still significantly higher than the performance for CA19-9 taken as a single predictor, AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.64-0.93) and sensitivity of 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 – 0.69) (p= 0.013 and p=0.0055, respectively). <h4>CONCLUSION</h4> Our ensemble modelling technique outperformed CA19-9, individual biomarkers and prevailing algorithms in distinguishing patients with non-specific but concerning symptoms from those with PDAC, with implications for improving its early detection in individuals at risk.",

      "title": "Integrating multimodal data through interpretable heterogeneous ensembles",
      "abstract": "<h4>Motivation</h4> Integrating multimodal data represents an effective approach to predicting biomedical characteristics, such as protein functions and disease outcomes. However, existing data integration approaches do not sufficiently address the heterogeneous semantics of multimodal data. In particular, early and intermediate approaches that rely on a uniform integrated representation reinforce the consensus among the modalities, but may lose exclusive local information. The alternative late integration approach that can address this challenge has not been systematically studied for biomedical problems. <h4>Results</h4> We propose Ensemble Integration (EI) as a novel systematic implementation of the late integration approach. EI infers local predictive models from the individual data modalities using appropriate algorithms, and uses effective heterogeneous ensemble algorithms to integrate these local models into a global predictive model. We also propose a novel interpretation method for EI models. We tested EI on the problems of predicting protein function from multimodal STRING data, and mortality due to COVID-19 from multimodal data in electronic health records. We found that EI accomplished its goal of producing significantly more accurate predictions than each individual modality. It also performed better than several established early integration methods for each of these problems. The interpretation of a representative EI model for COVID-19 mortality prediction identified several disease-relevant features, such as laboratory test (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and calcium) and vital sign measurements (minimum oxygen saturation) and demographics (age). These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the EI framework for biomedical data integration and predictive modeling. <h4>Availability</h4> Code and data are available at https://github.com/GauravPandeyLab/ensemble_integration . <h4>Contact</h4> gaurav.pandey@mssm.edu",

      "abstract": "The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has gone out of control globally. Despite much effort by scientists, medical experts, and society in general, the slow progress on drug discovery and antibody therapeutic development, the unknown possible side effects of the existing vaccines, and the high transmission rate of the SARS-CoV-2, remind us of the sad reality that our current understanding of the transmission, infectivity, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is unfortunately very limited. The major limitation is the lack of mechanistic understanding of viral-host cell interactions, the viral regulation, protein-protein interactions, including antibody-antigen binding, protein-drug binding, host immune response, etc. This limitation will likely haunt the scientific community for a long time and have a devastating consequence in combating COVID-19 and other pathogens. Notably, compared to the long-cycle, highly cost, and safety-demanding molecular-level experiments, the theoretical and computational studies are economical, speedy, and easy to perform. There exists a tsunami of the literature on molecular modeling, simulation, and prediction of SARS-CoV-2 that has become impossible to fully be covered in a review. To provide the reader a quick update about the status of molecular modeling, simulation, and prediction of SARS-CoV-2, we present a comprehensive and systematic methodology-centered narrative in the nick of time. Aspects such as molecular modeling, Monte Carlo (MC) methods, structural bioinformatics, machine learning, deep learning, and mathematical approaches are included in this review. This review will be beneficial to researchers who are looking for ways to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 studies and those who are assessing the current status in the field.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Motivation</h4> Determining RNA binding protein(RBP) binding specificity is crucial for understanding many cellular processes and genetic disorders. RBP binding is known to be affected by both the sequence and structure of RNAs. Deep learning can be used to learn generalizable representations of raw data and has improved state of the art in several fields such as image classification, speech recognition and even genomics. Previous work on RBP binding has either used shallow models that combine sequence and structure or deep models that use only the sequence. Here we combine both abilities by augmenting and refining the original Deepbind architecture to capture structural information and obtain significantly better performance. <h4>Results</h4> We propose two deep architectures, one a lightweight convolutional network for transcriptome wide inference and another a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network that is suitable for small batches of data. We incorporate computationally predicted secondary structure features as input to our models and show its effectiveness in boosting prediction performance. Our models achieved significantly higher correlations on held out in-vitro test data compared to previous approaches, and generalise well to in-vivo CLIP-SEQ data achieving higher median AUCs than other approaches. We analysed the output from our model for VTS1 and CPO and provided intuition into its working. Our models confirmed known secondary structure preferences for some proteins as well as found new ones where secondary structure might play a role. We also demonstrated the strengths of our model compared to other approaches such as the ability to combine information from long distances along the input. <h4>Availability</h4> Software and models are available at https://github.com/shreshthgandhi/cDeepbind <h4>Contact</h4> ljlee@psi.toronto.edu , frey@psi.toronto.edu",

Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a drug repurposing pipeline that systematically integrates multiple SARS-CoV-2 and drug interactions, deep graph neural networks, and in-vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all the available drugs (n= 3,635) involved in COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a SARS-CoV-2 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and electronic health records. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deep neural networks, and rigorous validation can facilitate the rapid identification of candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

      "title": "Achilles' Heel of SARS-CoV-2: Transcription Regulatory Sequence and Leader Sequence in 5’ Untranslated Region have Unique Evolutionary Patterns and are Vital for Virus Replication in Infected Human Cells",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background: </h4> SARS-CoV-2 has generated a life-treating pandemic and is the main challenge of this century. Some untranslated regions (UTRs) in SARS-CoV-2 genome, specifically leader sequence and transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) in 5&rsquo;UTR, can be considered as Achilles' heel of virus. Leader sequence are found at the 5' ends of all encoded transcripts that highlights its importance. TRS can explain the host range and pathogenicity of coronavirus. However, our knowledge on the evolution and the role of UTRs in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is very limited. This study is a pioneering attempt to unravel the evolution of key regions in 5' UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and discover the inhibitory microRNAs against 5' UTR of virus. Methods Evolution of TRS and leader sequence was compared between human pathogenic (SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS) and non-pathogenic (bovine) coronaviruses. Profiling of microRNAs that can inactive the key UTR regions of coronaviruses, UTR-inhibitory microRNAs, was carried out. Findings We found a distinguished pattern of evolution in leader sequence and TRS of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the other coronaviruses. Mining all available microRNA families against leader sequences of coronaviruses resulted in discovery of 39 microRNAs with an acceptable thermodynamic binding energy against SARS-COV-2, SARS, MERS, Bat Coronavirus, or Bovine Coronavirus. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a distinguished pattern of binding of leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 against microRNAs, with a lower binding stability. hsa-MIR-5004-3p was the only human microRNA that can target leader sequence of SARS and SARS-CoV-2. However, its binding stability remarkably decreased in SARS-COV-2 (-19.4 kcal/mol), compared to SARS-COV-2 (-25.9 kcal/mol). We found an insertion-type mutation in leader sequence of SARS-COV-2 that results in lower binding stability and escaping of viral leader sequence from hsa-MIR-5004-3p. Altogether, we suggest lack of innate human inhibitory microRNAs to bind to leader sequence and TRS of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to its high replication in infected human cells. On the other hand, mining of two hundred million deposited human genomic variants led us to discovery of 49 missense and splice-disrupt mutations in genomic structure of hsa-MIR-5004-3p. These mutations can negatively affect hsa-MIR-5004-3p function in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interpretation This study unravels the evolution of key regions in 5&rsquo;UTR of SARS-CoV-2. Inducing microRNAs to bind to the leader sequence and TRS regions by drugs or food supplements can reduce virus replication. Enhancing the microRNA defence machinery against TRS and leader of virus has a potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection at the first place. The mentioned strategy is rapidly achievable against COVID-19. Missense variation in genomic sequence of 5&rsquo;UTR inhibitory microRNAs, such as hsa-MIR-5004-3p, can be considered as risk factor of COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Many proteins remain poorly characterized even in well-studied organisms, presenting a bottleneck for research. We applied phenomics and machine-learning approaches with  Schizosaccharomyces pombe for broad cues on protein functions. We assayed colony-growth phenotypes to measure the fitness of deletion mutants for 3509 non-essential genes in 131 conditions with different nutrients, drugs, and stresses. These analyses exposed phenotypes for 3492 mutants, including 124 mutants of ‘priority unstudied’ proteins conserved in humans, providing varied functional clues. For example, over 900 proteins were newly implicated in the resistance to oxidative stress. Phenotype-correlation networks suggested roles for poorly characterized proteins through ‘guilt by association’ with known proteins. For complementary functional insights, we predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms using machine learning methods exploiting protein-network and protein-homology data (NET-FF). We obtained 56,594 high-scoring GO predictions, of which 22,060 also featured high information content. Our phenotype-correlation data and NET-FF predictions showed a strong concordance with existing PomBase GO annotations and protein networks, with integrated analyses revealing 1,675 novel GO predictions for 783 genes, including 47 predictions for 23 priority unstudied proteins. Experimental validation identified new proteins involved in cellular ageing, showing that these predictions and phenomics data provide a rich resource to uncover new protein functions.",

      "abstract": "Whereas accelerated attention beclouded early stages of the coronavirus spread, knowledge of actual pathogenicity and origin of possible sub-strains remained unclear. By harvesting the Global initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https://www.gisaid.org/), between December 2019 and January 15, 2021, a total of 8864 human SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences processed by gender, across 6 continents (88 countries) of the world, Antarctica exempt, were analyzed. We hypothesized that data speaks for itself and can discern true and explainable patterns of the disease. Identical genome diversity and pattern correlates analysis performed using a hybrid of biotechnology and machine learning methods corroborate the emergence of inter- and intra- SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains. Interestingly, some viral sub-strain patterns progressively transformed into new sub-strain clusters indicating varying amino acid and strong nucleotide association derived from same lineage. A novel cognitive approach to knowledge mining from enriched genome datasets and output classification targets, helped intelligent prediction of emerging or new viral sub-strains. Classification results outsmarted state-of-the-art methods and sustained an increase in sub-strains within the various continents with nucleotide mutations dynamically varying between individuals in close association with the virus adaptability to its host/environment. They also offer explanations for the growing concerns and next wave(s) of the virus. Defuzzifying confusable pattern clusters for comparative performance with the proposed cognitive solution is a possible future research direction of this paper.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the COVID-19 severity and why it differs significantly among patients is a thing of concern to the scientific community. The major contribution of this study arises from the use of a voting ensemble host genetic severity predictor (HGSP) model we developed by combining several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (decision tree-based models: Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers). These models were trained using a genetic Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset and clinical covariates (age and gender) formulated from a 5-fold stratified cross-validation computational strategy to randomly split the dataset to overcome model instability. Our study validated the HGSP model based on the 18 features (i.e., 16 identified candidate genetic variants and 2 covariates) identified from a prior study. We provided post-hoc model explanations through the ExplainerDashboard - an open-source python library framework, allowing for deeper insight into the prediction results. We applied the Enrichr and OpenTarget genetics bioinformatic interactive tools to associate the genetic variants for plausible biological insights, and domain interpretations such as pathways, ontologies, and disease/drugs. Through an unsupervised clustering of the SHAP feature importance values, we visualized the complex genetic mechanisms. Our findings show that while age and gender mainly influence COVID-19 severity, a specific group of patients experiences severity due to complex genetic interactions.",

      "abstract": "Computer-Aided Diagnosis has shown stellar performance in providing accurate medical diagnoses across multiple testing modalities (medical images, electrophysiological signals, etc.). While this field has typically focused on fully harvesting the signal provided by a single (and generally extremely reliable) modality, fewer efforts have utilized imprecise data lacking reliable ground truth labels. In this unsupervised, noisy setting, the robustification and quantification of the diagnosis uncertainty become paramount, thus posing a new challenge: how can we combine multiple sources of information -- often themselves with vastly varying levels of precision and uncertainty -- to provide a diagnosis estimate with confidence bounds? Motivated by a concrete application in antibody testing, we devise a Stochastic Expectation-Maximization algorithm that allows the principled integration of heterogeneous, and potentially unreliable, data types. Our Bayesian formalism is essential in (a) flexibly combining these heterogeneous data sources and their corresponding levels of uncertainty, (b) quantifying the degree of confidence associated with a given diagnostic, and (c) dealing with the missing values that typically plague medical data. We quantify the potential of this approach on simulated data, and showcase its practicality by deploying it on a real COVID-19 immunity study.",

Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a drug repurposing pipeline that systematically integrates multiple SARS-CoV-2 and drug interactions, deep graph neural networks, and in-vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all the available drugs (n= 3,635) involved in COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a SARS-CoV-2 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate drug’s representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and electronic health records. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deep neural networks, and rigorous validation can facilitate the rapid identification of candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> A computational approach to identifying drug–target interactions (DTIs) is a credible strategy for accelerating drug development and understanding the mechanisms of action of small molecules. However, current methods are limited to providing simple DTIs without mode of action (MoA), or they show unsatisfactory performance for a limited range of compounds and targets. Here, we propose AI-DTI, a novel method that predicts activatory and inhibitory DTIs by combining the mol2vec and genetically perturbed transcriptomes. We trained the model on large-scale DTIs with MoA and found that our model outperformed a previous model that predicted activatory and inhibitory DTIs. To extend the applicability, we applied the inferential method for the target vector so that our method can learn and predict a wider range of targets. Our method achieved satisfactory performance in an independent dataset where the target was unseen in the training set and a high-throughput screening dataset where positive and negative samples were explicitly defined. Finally, our method successfully rediscovered approximately half of the DTIs for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. These results indicate that AI-DTI is a practically useful tool for guiding drug discovery processes and generating plausible hypotheses that can reveal unknown mechanisms of drug action.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box predictors that have achieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, their accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.",

Currently no approved drug or vaccine exists against SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, is a time efficient approach to find effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in this emergency situation. Both experimental and computational approaches are being employed in drug repurposing with computational approaches becoming increasingly popular and efficient. In this study, we present a robust experimental design combining deep learning with molecular docking experiments to identify most promising candidates from the list of FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. We have employed a deep learning based Drug Target Interaction (DTI) model, called DeepDTA, with few improvements to predict drug-protein binding affinities, represented as KIBA scores, for 2,440 FDA approved and 8,168 investigational drugs against 24 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. FDA approved drugs with the highest KIBA scores were selected for molecular docking simulations. We ran docking simulations for 168 selected drugs against 285 total predicted and/or experimentally proven active sites of all 24 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. We used a recently published open source AutoDock based high throughput screening platform virtualflow to reduce the time required to run around 50,000 docking simulations. A list of 49 most promising FDA approved drugs with best consensus KIBA scores and AutoDock vina binding affinity values against selected SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins is generated. Most importantly, anidulafungin, velpatasvir, glecaprevir, rifabutin, procaine penicillin G, tadalafil, riboflavin 5’-monophosphate, flavin adenine dinucleotide, terlipressin, desmopressin, elbasvir, oxatomide, enasidenib, edoxaban and selinexor demonstrate highest predicted inhibitory potential against key SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins.",

      "abstract": "Counterfactual inference is a useful tool for comparing outcomes of interventions on complex systems. It requires us to represent the system in form of a structural causal model, complete with a causal diagram, probabilistic assumptions on exogenous variables, and functional assignments. Specifying such models can be extremely difficult in practice. The process requires substantial domain expertise, and does not scale easily to large systems, multiple systems, or novel system modifications. At the same time, many application domains, such as molecular biology, are rich in structured causal knowledge that is qualitative in nature. This manuscript proposes a general approach for querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and converting the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model that can learn from data to answer the question. We demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy and versatility of this approach using two case studies in systems biology. The first demonstrates the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the results. The second demonstrates the versatility of the approach by querying a knowledge base for the molecular determinants of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced cytokine storm, and performing counterfactual inference to estimate the causal effect of medical countermeasures for severely ill patients.",

Understanding the complex cellular sociology in organoids requires integration of imaging modalities across spatial and temporal scales. We present a multi-scale imaging approach that traverses millimeter-scale live-cell light microscopy to nano-scale volume electron microscopy by performing 3D cell cultures in a single carrier amenable to all imaging steps. This allows to follow organoids growth, probe their morphology with fluorescent markers, identify areas of interest and analyze their 3D ultrastructure. We demonstrate this workflow on mouse and human 3D cultures, and use automated image segmentation to annotate and quantitatively analyze subcellular structures in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids.

      "title": "Advancing the Management of Long COVID by Integrating into Health Informatics Domain: Current and Future Perspectives",
      "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected millions of lives globally, with some individuals experiencing persistent symptoms even after recovering. Understanding and managing the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 is crucial for research, prevention, and control. As a result, to monitor the health of individuals affected by these conditions, they must maintain up-to-date health records using digital health informatics apps for surveillance. In this review, we provide an overview of the existing literature on identifying long COVID manifestations through hierarchical classification and the characterization of long COVID by different hierarchical groups based on the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We outline the aspects of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) and Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) in artificial intelligence (AI) to identify long COVID. Knowledge exploration, using the concept map for the clinical pathways of long COVID presented in this paper, provides an overview of the data needed to explore tackling the long-term effect of COVID-19 by integrating innovative cohesive frameworks and designing health informatics-based applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the potential incorporation of long COVID as a variable risk factor within a digital health informatics application.",

      "abstract": "Protein-RNA interactions underpin many critical biological processes, demanding the development of technologies to precisely characterize their nature and functions. Many such technologies depend upon cross-linking under mild irradiation conditions to stabilize contacts between amino acids and nucleobases; for example, the cross-linking of stable isotope labelled RNA coupled to mass spectrometry (CLIR-MS) method. A deeper understanding of the CLIR-MS workflow is required to maximize its impact for structural biology, particularly addressing the low abundance of cross-linking products and the information content of spatial/geometric restraints reflected by a cross-link. Here, we present a vastly improved CLIR-MS pipeline that features enhanced sample preparation, data acquisition and interpretation. These advances significantly increase the number of detected cross-link products per sample. We demonstrate that the procedure is robust against variation of key experimental parameters, including irradiation energy and temperature. Using this improved protocol on four protein-RNA complexes representing canonical and non-canonical RNA-binding domains, we propose for the first time the distances encoded by protein-RNA cross-links, enabling their use as structural restraints. We also compared the cross-linking of canonical RNA with 4-thiouracil-labeled counterparts, showing slight, but noticeable differences. The improved understanding of protein-RNA cross-links refines the structural interpretation of complexes and facilitates the adoption of the method in integrative/hybrid structural biology.",

      "title": "Logical Analysis of Response of Health Officials’ Worldwide, to Cost-Effective Early Remedies for COVID19",
      "abstract": "With the advent of COVID19, the attitude of health authorities around the world, led mainly by the West, demanded a level of proof as evidence for cheap, non-patented remedies while promoting expensive, patented, and untested remedies by using emergency use authorization and special provisions afforded to the status of a pandemic emergency. Western science has neither a tested nor a valid historical basis of a logical system that informs to authenticate scientific practices. Here we use a logical heuristic derived from ancient Buddhist logic, which is consistent with the conduct of modern science. We applied the heuristic to show that enough evidence was available for using cost-effective early therapies such as vitamin D supplementation as a public health measure during the first half of 2020. Strong supporting evidence has since accumulated. Apart from political and financial decisions incompatible with science and other conflicts of interest, a critical barrier to evaluating and approving early therapies appears to be the fallacy that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the superior proof method in medical hypotheses, including those for nutrients. Logically, no reason exists why properly designed retrospective, ecological, and naturalistic studies with adequate sample sizes and applied appropriate statistical methods would not be as valid as RCTs, especially when elucidating a causative factor instead of treatment. That assertion is particularly true for nutrient deficiencies, interventions, and other cost-effective therapies. Leading health authorities’ failure or refusal to consider other study types (because of either poor logic or vested interest) probably contributed to the spread of misinformation, symptomatic disease, complications, and deaths from COVID19. Partial immunity derived from vaccines and the later development of more contagious variants—and thus a sense of acceptance that SARS-CoV-2 had progressed from a pandemic to an endemic—shows the hollowness of the initial promotions and mandates of vaccines as a cure. Adequate knowledge was available in 2020 to advise that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate, with variants emerging a few times per year, making the vaccine less effective. Emerging evidence confirms that natural immunity better protects against new variants than vaccination against the spike protein. Had vitamin D been adopted as part of the public health measure through a broader supplementation program in 2020 or even today (through sun exposure or as a prophylactic or adjunct therapy early on), the viral spread and symptomatic disease may have been suppressed, with minimal lockdowns and quarantine, and economic harm. The pandemic could have been halted with a significantly reduced need for hospitalization, complications, and deaths, potentially saving millions of lives.",

      "abstract": "A COVID-19 vaccine is our best bet for mitigating the ongoing onslaught of the pandemic. However, vaccine is also expected to be a limited resource. An optimal allocation strategy, especially in countries with access inequities and temporal separation of hot-spots, might be an effective way of halting the disease spread. We approach this problem by proposing a novel pipeline VacSIM that dovetails Deep Reinforcement Learning models into a Contextual Bandits approach for optimizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Whereas the Reinforcement Learning models suggest better actions and rewards, Contextual Bandits allow online modifications that may need to be implemented on a day-to-day basis in the real world scenario. We evaluate this framework against a naive allocation approach of distributing vaccine proportional to the incidence of COVID-19 cases in five different States across India (Assam, Delhi, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Nagaland) and demonstrate up to 9039 potential infections prevented and a significant increase in the efficacy of limiting the spread over a period of 45 days through the VacSIM approach. Our models and the platform are extensible to all states of India and potentially across the globe. We also propose novel evaluation strategies including standard compartmental model-based projections and a causality-preserving evaluation of our model. Since all models carry assumptions that may need to be tested in various contexts, we open source our model VacSIM and contribute a new reinforcement learning environment compatible with OpenAI gym to make it extensible for real-world applications across the globe.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Over the last few decades there is a progressive transition from a categorical to a dimensional approach to psychiatric disorders. Especially in case of substance use disorders, the increased interest in the individual vulnerability to transition from controlled to compulsive drug seeking and taking warrants the development of novel dimension-based objective diagnostic or stratification tools. Here we drew on a multidimensional preclinical model of addiction, namely the 3-criteria model, previously developed to identify the neurobehavioural basis of the individual vulnerability to switch from control to compulsive drug taking, to test the potential interest of a machine-learning assisted classifier objectively to identify individual subjects as vulnerable or resistant to addiction. <h4>Methods</h4> Large behavioural datasets from several of our previous studies on addiction-like behaviour for cocaine or alcohol were fed to a variety of machine-learning algorithms (each consisting of an unsupervised-clustering method combined with a supervised-prediction algorithm) to develop a classifier that identifies resilient and vulnerable rats with high precision and reproducibility irrespective of the cohort to which they belong. <h4>Results</h4> A classifier based on K-median or K-mean-clustering (for cocaine or alcohol, respectively) followed by Artificial Neural Networks emerged as a highly reliable and accurate tool to predict if a single rat is vulnerable or resilient to addiction. Thus, each of the rats previously characterized as displaying 0 criterion (i.e., resilient) or 3 criteria (i.e., vulnerable) in individual cohorts were correctly labelled by this classifier. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The present machine-learning-based classifier objectively labels single individuals as resilient or vulnerable to develop addiction-like behaviour in multisymptomatic preclinical models of cocaine or alcohol addiction-like behaviour in rats. This novel dimension-based classifier thereby increases the heuristic value and generalizability of these preclinical models while providing proof of principle for the deployment of similar tools for the future of diagnosis of psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "The rapid detection of outbreaks is a key step in the effective control and containment of infectious diseases. In particular, the identification of cases which might be epidemiologically linked is crucial in directing outbreak-containment efforts shaping the intervention of public health authorities. Often this requires the detection of clusters of cases whose numbers exceed those expected by a background of sporadic cases. Quantifying exceedances rapidly is particularly challenging when only few cases are typically reported in a precise location and time. To address such important public health concerns, we present a general method which can detect spatio-temporal deviations from a Poisson point process and estimate the odd of an isolate being part of a cluster. This method can be applied to diseases where detailed geographical information is available. In addition, we propose an approach to explicitly take account of delays in microbial typing. As a case study, we considered invasive group A Streptococcus infection events as recorded and typed by Public Health England from 2015 to 2020.",

The governments, hospitals, schools, industries, and humans, in general, are looking for a potential solution in the vaccine which will eventually be available but its timeline for eradicating the virus is yet unknown. Several researchers have encouraged and recommended the use of good practices such as physical healthcare monitoring, immunity-boosting, personal hygiene, mental healthcare, and contact tracing for slowing down the spread of the virus. In this article, we propose the use of wearable/mobile sensors integrated with the Internet of Everything to cover the spectrum of good practices in an automated manner. We present hypothetical frameworks for each of the good practice modules and propose the COvid-19 Resistance Framework using the Internet of Everything (CORFIE) to tie all the individual modules in a unified architecture. We envision that CORFIE would be influential in assisting people with the new normal for current and future pandemics as well as instrumental in halting the economic losses, respectively.

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Contact tracing is a key tool in epidemiology to identify and control outbreaks of infectious diseases. Existing contact tracing methodologies produce contact maps of individuals based on a binary definition of contact which can be hampered by missing data and indirect contacts. Here, we present a Spatial-temporal Epidemiological Proximity (StEP) model to recover contact maps in disease outbreaks based on movement data. The StEP model accounts for imperfect data by considering probabilistic contacts between individuals based on spatial-temporal proximity of their movement trajectories, creating a robust movement network despite possible missing data and unseen transmission routes. Using real-world data we showcase the potential of StEP for contact tracing with outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria and COVID-19 in a large hospital group in London, UK. In addition to the core structure of contacts that can be recovered using traditional methods of contact tracing, the StEP model reveals missing contacts that connect seemingly separate outbreaks. Comparison with genomic data further confirmed that these recovered contacts indeed improve characterisation of disease transmission and so highlights how the StEP framework can inform effective strategies of infection control and prevention.",

      "abstract": "We recently described a dynamic causal model of a COVID-19 outbreak within a single region. Here, we combine several of these (epidemic) models to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity--and the exchange of people between regions--and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.",

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated that current national and organisational response mechanisms are inadequate regarding scientific and technological capabilities and approaches. Technologies are one of the key response mechanisms for such chaos. Previous studies theorised on the various manners in which chaos occurs and leads to significant effects concerning its stages and cycles. However, no studies exist on the way technologies respond and progress during a chaotic event. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop the first Theory of Technological Response and Progress in Chaos (TRPC) and examine the case of technological development during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study uses grounded theory as a methodology, with a mixed-method approach that included quantitative and qualitative approaches. We implemented machine learning and text mining to aid in the stages of the grounded theory approach. As a result of the TRPC theory development process, we identified three types of technologies (survival, essential and enhancement technologies) and five types of periods (stable, initial, survival-dominant, essential-dominant and enhancement-dominant periods) that are specific to chaos-technology interactions. The policy implications of our study demonstrate that a required technological base and know-how must be established before a chaos event emerges. Our theory helps for responses and policy development for future chaos.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Objectives</h4> With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, public health focus is shifting to post-vaccination surveillance to identify breakthrough infections in vaccinated populations. Therefore, the objectives of these reviews are to identify scientific evidence and international guidance on surveillance and testing approaches to monitor the presence of the virus in a vaccinated population. <h4>Method</h4> We searched Ovid MEDLINE®, including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We also searched the Web of Science Core Collection. A grey literature search was also conducted. This search was limited to studies conducted since December 2020 and current to June 13th, 2021. There were no language limitations. COVID-19 surveillance studies that were published after December 2020 but did not specify whether they tested a vaccinated population were also considered for inclusion. For the international guidance review, a grey literature search was conducted, including a thorough search of Google, websites of international government organizations (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], World Health Organization [WHO]), and McMaster Health Forum (CoVID-END). This search was primarily examining surveillance guidance published since December 2020 (to capture guidance specific to vaccinations) and any relevant pre-December 2020 guidance. <h4>Results</h4> Thirty-three studies were included for data synthesis of scientific evidence on surveillance of COVID-19. All the studies were published between April and June 2021. Twenty-one studies were from peer-reviewed journals. Five approaches to monitoring post-vaccination COVID-19 cases and emerging variants of concern were identified, including screening with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or a rapid antigen test, genomic surveillance, wastewater surveillance, metagenomics, and testing of air filters on public buses. For population surveillance, the following considerations and limitations were observed: variability in person-to-person testing frequency; lower sensitivity of antigen tests; timing of infections relative to PCR testing can result in missed infections; large studies may fail to identify local variations; and loss of interest in testing by participants in long follow-up studies. Through comprehensive grey literature searching, 68 international guidance documents were captured for full-text review. A total of 26 documents met the inclusion criteria and were included in our synthesis. Seven overarching surveillance methods emerged in the literature. PCR-testing was the most recommended surveillance method, followed by genomic screening, serosurveillance, wastewater surveillance, antigen testing, health record screening, and syndromic surveillance. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Evidence for post-vaccination COVID-19 surveillance was derived from studies in partially or fully vaccinated populations. Population PCR screening, supplemented by rapid antigen tests, was the most frequently used surveillance method and also the most commonly recommended across jurisdictions. Most recent guidance on COVID-19 surveillance is not specific to vaccinated individuals, or it is in effect but has not yet been updated to reflect that. Therefore, more evidence-informed guidance on testing and surveillance approaches in a vaccinated population that incorporates all testing modalities is required. <h4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4> <h4>Objectives</h4> With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, public health focus is shifting to post-vaccination surveillance to identify breakthrough infections in vaccinated populations. Therefore, the objectives of these reviews are to: 1) identify scientific evidence on surveillance and testing approaches to monitor the presence of the virus in a vaccinated population and determine how these influence testing strategies; 2) identify international guidance on testing and surveillance for COVID-19 and its variants of concern in a vaccinated population; and 3) identify emerging technologies for surveillance. <h4>Design</h4> A rapid review was conducted to identify scientific evidence on COVID-19 surveillance and testing approaches, and a targeted literature review was conducted on international guidance. <h4>Method</h4> We searched Ovid MEDLINE®, including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

For the international guidance review, a grey literature search was conducted, including a thorough search of Google, websites of international government organizations (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], World Health Organization [WHO]), and McMaster Health Forum (CoVID-END). This search was primarily examining surveillance guidance published since December 2020 (to capture guidance specific to vaccinations) and any relevant pre-December 2020 guidance. Although the primary focus was on surveillance guidance in a vaccinated population, guidance that was published after December 2020 but was not vaccine-specific was also considered for inclusion; it was assumed that this guidance was still in effect and was not yet updated. There were no language limitations. A patient partner was engaged during the co-production of a plain language summary for both the rapid review of primary literature and the review of international guidance. <h4>Results</h4> Thirty-three studies were included for data synthesis of scientific evidence on surveillance of COVID-19. All the studies were published between April and June 2021. Twenty-one studies were from peer-reviewed journals. Five approaches to monitoring post-vaccination COVID-19 cases and emerging variants of concern were identified including, screening with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or a rapid antigen test, genomic surveillance, wastewater surveillance, metagenomics, and testing of air filters on public buses. Population surveillance with RT-PCR testing and/or rapid antigen testing was utilized in 22 studies, mostly in healthcare settings, but also in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and in the community. The frequency of testing varied depending on whether there was an outbreak. For population surveillance, the following considerations and limitations were observed: studies with discretionary access to testing have highly variable person-to-person testing frequency; antigen tests have lower sensitivity, therefore some positive cases may be missed; timing of infections relative to PCR testing as well as the sensitivity of the tests can result in missed infections; large sample sizes from multicentre studies increase generalizability, but fail to identify local variations from individual centres; with electronic database surveillance, it is difficult to confirm whether patients with a breakthrough infection and a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result had a true reinfection or had prolonged shedding from the previous infection; and participants lose interest in studies with long follow-up, with decrease in testing rates over time. Six wastewater surveillance and three genomic surveillance studies were identified in this review. A number of benefits such as, good correlation with clinical data, ability to predict major outbreaks, and rapid turnaround time were observed with wastewater surveillance. However, challenges such as, inconsistencies in variant representation depending on where the samples were taken within the community, differences in the capacity of wastewater to predict case numbers based on the size of the wastewater treatment plants, and cost, were noted. Emerging technologies like viral detection in public transport filters, novel sampling, and assay platforms were also identified. Through comprehensive grey literature searching, 68 international guidance documents were captured for full-text review. A total of 26 documents met the inclusion criteria and were included in our synthesis. Most were not specific to vaccinated populations but reported on a surveillance method of COVID-19 and were therefore included in the review; it was assumed that they were still in effect but have not yet been updated. Eleven countries/regions were represented, including Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Europe, and International. All of the guidance documents included surveillance methods appropriate for community settings. Other settings of interest were healthcare settings, including hospitals and primary care centres, long-term care facilities, points of entry for travel, schools, and other sentinel sites (e.g., prisons and closed settings). Seven overarching surveillance methods emerged in the literature. PCR-testing was the most recommended surveillance method, followed by genomic screening, serosurveillance, wastewater surveillance, antigen testing, health record screening, and syndromic surveillance. Only one document (published by Public Health England) was identified that provided guidance on surveillance specific to vaccinated populations. The document outlined a plan to surveil and monitor COVID-19 in vaccinated populations through a series of targeted longitudinal studies, routine surveillance, enhanced surveillance, use of electronic health records, surveillance of vaccine failure (including follow-up with viral whole genome sequencing), and sero-surveillance (including blood donor samples, routine blood tests, and residual sera). <h4>Conclusion</h4> Evidence for post-vaccination COVID-19 surveillance was derived from studies in partially or fully vaccinated populations. Population PCR screening, supplemented by rapid antigen tests, was the most frequently used surveillance method and also the most commonly recommended across jurisdictions. The selection of testing method and the frequency of testing was determined by the intensity of the disease and the scale of testing. Other common testing methods included wastewater surveillance and genomic surveillance. A few novel technologies are emerging, however, many of these are yet to be utilized in the real-world setting. There is limited evidence-based guidance on surveillance in a vaccinated population. Most recent guidance on COVID-19 surveillance is not specific to vaccinated individuals, or it is in effect but has not yet been updated to reflect that. Therefore, more evidence-informed guidance on testing and surveillance approaches in a vaccinated population that incorporates all testing modalities is required. <h4>Protocol/Topic Registration</h4> PROSPERO-CRD42021261215. <h4>Key Definitions</h4> Antigen: a foreign protein which induces an immune response in the body, especially the production of antibodies Fully vaccinated refers to individuals who have received complete dosage of a given vaccine Partially vaccinated: refers to individuals who have received an incomplete dosage of a given vaccine Sero-surveillance: estimation of antibody levels against infectious diseases Surveillance: ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data that are essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice Variants of Concern: a variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility and/or more severe disease Variants: virus with a permanent change in its genetic sequence",

      "abstract": "A mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication cycle is essential to develop new therapies for the COVID-19 global health crisis. In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with the viral genome, and propose a model of viral packaging through LLPS. N-protein condenses with specific RNA sequences in the first 1000 nts (5’-End) under physiological conditions and is enhanced at human upper airway temperatures. N-protein condensates exclude non-packaged RNA sequences. We comprehensively map sites bound by N-protein in the 5’-End and find preferences for single-stranded RNA flanked by stable structured elements. Liquid-like N-protein condensates form in mammalian cells in a concentration-dependent manner and can be altered by small molecules. Condensation of N-protein is sequence and structure specific, sensitive to human body temperature, and manipulatable with small molecules thus presenting screenable processes for identifying antiviral compounds effective against SARS-CoV-2.",

      "abstract": "We report the results of the COVID Moonshot , a fully open-science, crowd sourced, structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. We discovered a non-covalent, non-peptidic inhibitor scaffold with lead-like properties that is differentiated from current main protease inhibitors. Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, machine learning, exascale molecular simulations, and high-throughput structural biology and chemistry. We generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. All compound designs (>18,000 designs), crystallographic data (>840 ligand-bound X-ray structures), assay data (>10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (>2,400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich open and IP-free knowledgebase for future anti-coronavirus drug discovery.",
