# Semantic Scholar query — Bulk Search API (/paper/search/bulk)
# Boolean: + (AND), | (OR), - (NOT)
# Filters: year=2018-2026, fieldsOfStudy=Computer Science,Biology
# Fields: title,abstract,authors,year,venue,externalIds,citationCount,fieldsOfStudy,publicationTypes,openAccessPdf,publicationDate
# Pagination: continuation tokens (1000 results per page, up to 10M total)
# Concept: Block A (bio) AND Block B (text/language) AND Block C (FM + generative)

# Main query (bulk search Boolean syntax)
("single-cell" | "single cell" | "scRNA-seq" | "RNA-seq" | "gene expression" | transcriptomics | genomics | proteomics | epigenomics | "spatial transcriptomics" | "multi-omics") + ("language model" | LLM | "large language model" | "natural language" | GPT | CLIP | multimodal | "multi-modal" | "cross-modal" | tokeniz* | prompt | NLP | "text generation") + ("foundation model" | pretrain* | "self-supervised" | transformer | generative | decoder | autoregressive | "transfer learning" | "zero-shot" | "deep learning")

# Supplementary query 1 — specific model names
(scGPT | tGPT | LangCell | ChatCell | CellWhisperer | GenePT | GeneGPT | CellPLM | Nicheformer | EpiAgent | PathOmCLIP)

# Supplementary query 2 — cell + language focus
("cell" + "language model") | ("gene" + "GPT") | ("single-cell" + "LLM") | ("biological" + "language model")

# Note: Use /paper/search/bulk endpoint, NOT /paper/search (which doesn't support Boolean)
# Filter results: keep only those with openAccessPdf (OA requirement)
