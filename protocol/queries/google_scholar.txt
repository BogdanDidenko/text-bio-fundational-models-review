# Google Scholar query (manual search via browser or MCP tool)
# GS has limited Boolean support — simplify the query
# Max ~256 chars per query, max ~1000 results accessible
# Date filter: set Custom range 2018-2026 in GS interface
# Role: Supplementary source for validation and grey literature

# Primary search (key terms from all 3 blocks, simplified)
"foundation model" "gene expression" "language model" single-cell
# Expected: captures papers at intersection of LLM + biology + FM

# Supplementary search 1 — GPT + bio
GPT "single cell" "gene expression" generative
# Expected: scGPT, tGPT, GenePT

# Supplementary search 2 — NL + cell
"natural language" "single-cell" "cell type" foundation model
# Expected: LangCell, ChatCell, CellWhisperer

# Supplementary search 3 — multimodal LLM + bio
multimodal LLM genomics transcriptomics "foundation model"

# Supplementary search 4 — specific model names
scGPT OR tGPT OR LangCell OR ChatCell OR CellWhisperer OR GenePT OR GeneGPT OR CellPLM OR Nicheformer OR EpiAgent

# Supplementary search 5 — multi omics + LLM (v3.1)
"multi omics" "language model" "foundation model" transformer

# Supplementary search 6 — RNA seq + LLM (v3.1)
"RNA seq" LLM "foundation model" generative single-cell

# Note: GS results require aggressive post-hoc filtering
# Cross-reference with PubMed/Scopus results to identify unique GS-only finds
